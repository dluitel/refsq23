2.0 General Description
This section of this SRS describes the general factors that
effect the THEMAS system and its requirements.  This section does
not state specific requirements, it only makes these requirements
easier understood.
2.1 Product Perspective
The THEMAS system is a system that operates independent of any other system, or any components of the heating and cooling system to which it is attached. The THEMAS system, however, is composed mainly of a hardware and software portion. This SRS only specifies the requirements dealing with the software portion of the system. If assumptions or dependencies about the hardware were made, they are stated in this section of the SRS.
2.2 Product Functions
The THEMAS system is divided into four major sections:  Monitor
Temperature, Determine Utilization, Initialize System, and System
Reports.  All four sections have an associated software
configuration item;  all except the System Reports have an
associated hardware configuration item.  The hardware
requirements are contained in the system specification.  The
functions of the software for the system are contained in the
following paragraphs.
2.2.1 Monitor Temperature
The monitor temperature function receives the valid temperature and system parameters. The function then goes through the process of determining temperature status. After this process is done, either temperature limit is exceeded or the temperature change is requested. If the temperature change is requested, then the determine heating/cooling mode process is activated and makes a heating/cooling request. Some other processes that help the monitor temperature function are: validate temperature, change thermostat setting, generate alarm, and system initialization.
2.2.2 Determine Utilization
The determine utilization function receives the heating/cooling request and utilization parameters. The function then processes the status of all heating/cooling units and sends out either unit unavailable or heating/cooling unit needed. The fun ction generates either a unit unavailable event which goes into the System Reports function or it generates a heating/cooling signal to turn on/off the units. The Monitor Temperature and Initialize System functions help the determine utilization to do its
processes.
2.2.3 Initialize System
The initialize system function receives the initialization data for the THEMAS system. The processes that are associated with it are: load heating/cooling unit definitions, turn off all heating/cooling units, load thermostat definitions, load utilization parameters, set trigger values, set overtemperature values, and establish valid temperature range. The outgoing information that starts the entire THEMAS system is: clear all heating/cooling signals, send thermostat definitions, send utilization parameters, send trigger values, send overtemperature values, and send valid temperature range.
2.2.4 System Reports
The system reports function receives event data from the THEMAS system. This function is a database that stores all the events in the THEMAS system. This function is mainly for the use of
the supervisor of the THEMAS system to maintain an efficient heating and cooling system. The only process that interacts with the system reports function is the generate event data process.
2.3 User Characteristics
This system is intended to be used by people that maintain the heating and cooling systems in a building. The system should not need intervention from outside users other than the supervisor to maintain operation of THEMAS. The system should provide warnings to the supervisor about faulty temperatures. The displaying of the current status of the system to the supervisor should not contain excessive information which could confuse the supervisor. The system should provide information in the form of reports to the supervisor so that the system can be run efficiently.
2.4 General Constraints
The general constraints of the THEMAS system focus on the functionality provided by the external devices connected to i t. The thermostats shall only provide temperature values and temperature settings. The heating and cooling units provide no feedback to the THEMAS system. When a signal is sent to a heating or cooling unit, no signal shall be available to allow the THEMAS system to determine if the signal sent to the unit was realized by the unit.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
In developing the requirements for the THEMAS system, several assumptions have been made about the thermostat hardware and the heating/cooling hardware. These assumptions are stated in the following paragraphs.
2.5.1 Operating System Assumptions
The THEMAS system shall be designed to run on the Microsoft ® Windows NTTM operating system. All the internal process communications shall be designed to operate on this operating system. Any communication with the thermostats and heating and cooling units shall be done through the interface to these units. These interfaces shall run on this operating system as well.
2.5.2 Thermostat Hardware Assumptions
It is assumed that the thermostat is capable of returning the current temperature and the current desired temperature setting to the THEMAS system. The thermostat is constantly returning these values with no real time delay in between the thermostat and the THEMAS system. The thermostat also has the capability of being set and controlled by a user of the THEMAS system.
All data sent by the thermostat is in the correct format for the
THEMAS system to use.
2.5.3 Heating/Cooling Hardware Assumptions
It is assumed that the heating/cooling unit is incapable of returning its current off/on status to the THEMAS system.  The heating/cooling unit has no real time delay when sending these statuses to the THEMAS system.  The heating/cooling unit shall have the capability of being turned off and on by the supervisor of the THEMAS system.

Two types of temperature data shall be recognized from th e thermostats: 1) the temperature setting and 2) the current temperature. This module shall process both types of data.
A current temperature value that is received from an individual
thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range
values.  If the current temperature value is strictly less than
the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the received
temperature value is strictly greater than the upper value of the
valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify
the current temperature value as an invalid temperature and shall
output an invalid temperature status.  Otherwise, the THEMAS
system shall output a valid temperature status.
A temperature setting value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values. If the temperature setting value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the temperature setting value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the temperature setting as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status. Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall realize the value for that thermostat’s temperature setting.

Temperatures that exceed the overtemperature limits shall be reported as such.  Temperatures that do not exceed these limits shall be output for subsequent processing.
3.1.4.1.2 Inputs
Valid Temperatures
Trigger Values
Overtemp Values
3.1.4.1.3 Processing
The THEMAS system shall compare the reported temperature value to the temperature setting and detect when the temperature value exceeds the specified limits. To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used:
LO : Lower Overtemperature Value = TSET - OD UO : Upper Overtemperature Value = TSET + OD
If T < LO or UO < T then the THEMAS system shall recognize this
condition as the temperature limit has been exceeded.  In this
case this process shall output the condition of the temperature
limit having been exceeded.
If LO < = T < = UO, then this process shall output the
temperature status.

3.1.4.2.2 Inputs
Temperature Trigger Exceeded
3.1.4.2.3 Processing
There are two conditions for each individual thermostat that shall be tested for: 1) the thermostat’s settings are satisfied and 2) the thermostat’s temperature indicates it requires a heating or cooling unit to be turned on. To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used:
LT : Lower Trigger Value = TSET - TD UT : Upper Trigger Value = TSET + TD
Condition 1:  LT < = T < = UT
This condition indicates the thermostat’s current temperature
setting is satisfied.  If this condition is true, then the module
shall output a request to turn off both the heating unit and the
cooling unit.
Condition2: LO<=T<LTorUT<T<=UO
This condition the need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned on. If this condition is true, then this module shall output a request to turn on the heating unit if LO < = T < LT or the cooling unit if UT < T < = UO.

3.1.5.1.3 Processing
The THEMAS system shall maintain the ON/OFF status of each
heating and cooling unit.  When a request to turn on or off a
heating or cooling unit, the following processing will occur.
When a request to turn on a heating or cooling unit is received, the system shall determine if the request can be honored. If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running, the request will be added to a LIFO queue. If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will generate a request to turn on the requested unit.
When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received, this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling requests. If the queue is not empty, this process shall remove one request from the LIFO queue and check the current state of the thermostat for which the queued request was made. If that thermostat still needs a heating or cooling unit turned on, this process shall submit a request to turn that unit on.
