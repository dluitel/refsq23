1.	Introduction
This document defines the functional requirements of the Number Portability Administration Center Service Management System (NPAC SMS) enabling Service Provider Portability. 
This introduction gives readers a brief overview of NPAC SMS functionality. It is intended to prepare you for the detailed sections that follow.  If you need more information on any particular area, please consult the applicable detailed sections in the remainder of this document or the NPAC SMS Interoperable Interface Specification. 
This introduction is also meant to convey the basic course of events that give the best understanding of the system. Alternate courses of events (variants of the basic course or error paths) are described in the detailed sections later in this document and in the NPAC SMS Interoperable Interface Specification.
1.1	NPAC SMS Platform Overview
The Number Portability Administration Center Service Management System (NPAC SMS) is a hardware and software platform, which contains the database of information required to effect the porting of telephone numbers.  In general, the NPAC SMS can receive customer information from both the old and new Service Providers (including the new Location Routing Number), validates the information received, and downloads the new routing information when an "activate" message is received indicating that the customer has been physically connected to the new Service Provider's network.  The NPAC SMS also contains a record of all ported numbers and a history file of all transactions relating to the porting of a number.  The NPAC SMS shall also provide audit functionality and the ability to transmit LNP routing information to Service Providers to maintain synchronization of Service Provider’s network elements that support LNP.

1.2	NPAC SMS Functional Overview
1.2.1	Provisioning Service Functionality
The new Service Provider will obtain authorization to port the customer and notify the old Service Provider according to processes internal to the Service Providers.  Both the old and new Service Providers can send a notification to the NPAC SMS from their Service Order Administration Systems (SOA).  When the NPAC SMS receives the notification(s), it will perform certain validation checks, and attempt to match the notification received from the new Service Provider with a concurring notification that may be sent from the old Service Provider.  Assuming the notifications are valid, the two Service Providers will complete any physical changes required.  When the new Service Provider due date is reached, the new Service Provider can send an activation notice to the NPAC SMS.  The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update out in real time to each local SMS.  Upon receiving the update from the NPAC SMS, all Service Providers will update their networks.  The NPAC SMS will record any transmission failures and take the appropriate action.
In the case where either the old or new Service Providers did not send a notification to the NPAC SMS, the NPAC SMS will notify the Service Provider from which it did not receive a notification that it is expecting a notification.  If it then receives the missing notification and the notifications indicate agreement among the Service Providers, the process proceeds as normal. If it still does not receive a notification and if it is the old Service Provider that failed to respond, the NPAC SMS will log the failure to respond and allow the new Service Provider to proceed with activation when the new Service Provider due date is reached.  If it was the new Service Provider that failed to respond, the NPAC will log the failure to respond, cancel the request, and notify both Service Providers of the cancellation.  If there is disagreement among the Service Providers as to who will be providing service for the telephone number, the conflict resolution procedures will be implemented (see Section 1.2.4). Processes for obtaining authorization from the customer to port a number are defined by the Service Providers.  The NPAC is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer approval to port a TN.
1.2.2	Disconnect Service Functionality
When a ported number is being disconnected, the customer and Service Provider will agree on a date. The current Service Provider will send an update indicating the disconnect to the NPAC SMS. The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update to all Service Providers based on the disconnect effective date and remove the telephone number from its database of ported numbers. Upon receiving the update, all Service Providers will remove the telephone number from their LNP databases. The NPAC SMS will log the update in history. Calls to the telephone number will be routed as a non¬-ported number.
1.2.3	Repair Service Functionality
A problem will be detected either by a Service Provider or by a customer contacting a Service Provider.
There will be audit capabilities in the NPAC SMS to aid in isolating problems. If an inaccuracy is found, the NPAC SMS will supply the correct data to any local SMS requesting updates.
1.2.4	Conflict Resolution Functionality
If Service Providers disagree on who will serve a particular line number, the NPAC SMS will place the request in the "conflict" state and notify both Service Providers of the conflict status and the Status Change Cause Code.  The Service Providers will determine who will serve the customer via internal processes.  When a resolution is reached, the NPAC will be notified and will remove the request from the "conflict" state by the new Service Provider.  The new Service Provider can cancel the Subscription Version.
1.2.5	Disaster Recovery and Backup Functionality
If there is unplanned downtime, the NPAC will assess how long the primary machine will be down.  The NPAC will notify all of the Service Providers of the situation and planned action by electronic notification and telephone calls to the Service Providers' contact numbers.  The Service Providers will attempt to switch to the backup NPAC.
1.2.6	Order Cancellation Functionality
If a Create Subscription has been sent by only the new Service Provider, the new Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version.  If a Create Subscription has been sent by only the old Service Provider, the old Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version.  If both Service Providers have sent a Create Subscription, either may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version.  If both Service Providers concur with the cancellation, the NPAC SMS will set the Subscription Version to canceled and notify both Service Providers that the Subscription Version has been canceled.  If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the new Service Provider the Subscription Version is placed in conflict by the NPAC SMS.  If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the old Service Provider, the Subscription Version is set to cancel by the NPAC SMS.
1.2.7	Audit Request Functionality
An audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting customer problems and also as a maintenance process to ensure Subscription Version data integrity across the entire LNP network. Audits will be concerned with the process of comparing the NPAC SMS view of the LNP network’s Subscription Version data with one or more of the Service Provider’s views of its network.  In the case of “on demand” audits, audits may be initiated by any Service Provider who has reason to believe a problem may exist in another Service Provider’s network.  These audits are executed via queries to the appropriate Service Provider’s network, and corrected via downloads to those same networks.
In addition, Local Service Providers will be responsible for comparing database extracts of Subscription data written to an FTP site by the NPAC SMS with their own versions of the same Subscription data.
In a third scenario, the NPAC SMS will select a random sample of active Subscription Versions from its own database, then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various Local SMS databases.  All three of the methods outlined above are designed to help ensure data integrity across the LNP network.
1.2.8	Report Request Functionality
The NPAC SMS supports report generation for pre-defined and ad-hoc reports.  The report generation function creates output report files according to specified format definitions, and distributes reports to output devices as requested.  The report distribution service supports distribution to electronic files local/remote printers, e-mail and FAX machines.
1.2.9	Data Management Functionality
The NPAC SMS will support functionality to manage network, Service Provider, and Subscription Version data.
1.2.9.1	NPAC Network Data
The NPAC SMS contains data, which defines the configuration of the LNP service and network.  This includes such data as: participating Service Providers, NPA NXXs that are portable, and LRNs associated with each Service Provider.
1.2.9.2	Service Provider Data
The Service Provider data indicates who the LNP Service Providers are and includes location, contact name, security, routing, and network interface information.
1.2.9.3	Subscription Version Data
The subscription data indicates how local number portability should operate to meet subscribers' needs.
1.2.10	NPA-NXX Split Processing
For an impending NPA split, there is no communication between each SOA and the NPAC via an electronic interface (SOA, LSMS, or NPAC Administrative Interface) other than providing the NPAC with the new network data (LRNs and NPA-NXXs), if applicable.  The NPAC inputs via the NPAC Administrative Interface the information for the NPA split (the current NPA, the new NPA, and the affected NXXs) plus the beginning and end date of the permissive dialing period.  This function of the NPAC Administrative Interface is only available to NPAC Operations personnel.
The NPAC will update its subscription version records when permissive dialing starts to the new NPA.  During the permissive dialing period the NPAC will accept messages with either old or new NPA but broadcasts/downloads with the new NPA only.  In addition, all notifications and responses to the SOA system will contain the new NPA only during the permissive dialing period regardless of whether the SOA system is using the old or new NPA in its requests to the NPAC SMS.  If a delete request is received, it is broadcast with the new NPA.  The subscription version ID that the NPAC SMS is aware of for the TN is used in the messages.
Based on information from the LERG, the service providers will update their networks/LSMS to accommodate the permissive dialing period and will update the data in their networks/LSMS after permissive dialing ends.  There is no communication from the NPAC to cause these updates to occur.   No assumptions are made about what the LSMS does during the permissive period to track the NPA-NXX split for a subscription version.
After permissive dialing ends, the NPAC removes any old NPA-NXXs and/or NPA-NXX-Xs related to the NPA Split that are no longer valid, and broadcasts these network data deletes to the appropriate SOAs/LSMSs.  Additionally, the service providers can remove any old LRNs that are no longer valid due to the split, if any, via an electronic interface (SOA, LSMS, or NPAC Administrative Interface).
1.2.11	Business Days/Hours
For support of service providers that have different needs for business hours and days available for porting, two types of business days/hours have been defined in the NPAC SMS.  The two types are long and short business days/hours.
The following table illustrates the outcome of business hours/days to be used based on the possible combinations:
Table 1 1 Business Day/Hour Behavior
1.2.12	Timer Types
For support of service providers that have different needs for timers available for porting, two types of timers have been defined in the NPAC SMS.  The two types are long and short timers.
The following table illustrates the outcome of timers to be used based on the possible combinations:
Table 1 2 Timer Type Behaviour
1.2.13	Recovery Functionality
The NPAC SMS provides a mechanism that allows a Service Provider to recover messages sent to either the SOA or LSMS, during a period of time that the Service Provider was not available to receive messages from the NPAC SMS.  This recovery mechanism (also referred to as resynchronization) is initiated when a Service Provider’s SOA or LSMS re-associates to the NPAC SMS, by setting the recovery mode indicator to TRUE on the Access Control structure, then requests the recovery of missed messages, by requesting the missed Network Data, Subscription Versions and Notifications.
The SOA requests network data and notification data for a specific period of time from the NPAC SMS, which is sent by the NPAC SMS as requested. During the recovery process, new messages are queued on the NPAC SMS.  Additionally, during the recovery process, the “x by y” retry functionality (where “x” is the number of attempts, and “y” is the interval in number of minutes in between attempts) continues on the NPAC SMS, but message sending is suspended to the SOA, and the retry attempts counter is not decremented, as long as the SOA is still in recovery mode.  Once the recovery is finished, the SOA sends a recovery complete message to the NPAC SMS, which in turn triggers the NPAC SMS to send the previously queued messages to the SOA, at the next normally scheduled retry interval.  At the completion of sending the previously queued messages, the interaction between the SOA and the NPAC SMS resumes for normal message processing.
The LSMS recovery functionality works similar to the SOA, with the addition of recovering subscription data.
1.2.13.1	Network Data Recovery
Network Data Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider for both SOA and LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all network data downloads that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider.  The processing steps for this functionality include:
1.	The Service Provider system sends a network data recovery request to the NPAC.
2.	The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.
3.	If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 2, signifying “time-range-invalid”.  No network data will be included with this reply.
4.	When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the network data recovery action and re-issue the request.
1.2.13.2	Subscription Data Recovery
Subscription Data Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider’s LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all subscription data downloads that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider.  The processing steps for this functionality include:
1.	The Service Provider system sends a subscription data recovery request to the NPAC.
2.	The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.
3.	If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 2, signifying “time-range-invalid”.  No subscription data will be included with this reply.
4.	When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the subscription data recovery action and re-issue the request.
1.2.13.3	Notification Recovery
Notification Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider for both SOA and LSMS to capture, via a recovery process, all notifications that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider.  The processing steps for this functionality include:
1.	The Service Provider system sends a notification recovery request to the NPAC.
2.	The NPAC retrieves the records that match the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.
3.	If the number of records exceeds the tunable value, a NetworkNotificationRecoveryReply is returned to the SP system with the status field populated with value 3, signifying “criteria-too-large”.  No notifications will be included with this reply.
4.	When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the notification recovery action and re-issue the request.
1.2.14	Number Pooling Overview
At the present time, the National Number Pooling approach includes the following:
1.	Pre-Port 1K Blocks to a single switch (i.e., all Pooled TNs contain same LRN).
2.	EDR (Efficient Data Representation) is captured through the use of “1K Blocks” in the NPAC, and over the SOA-to-NPAC and NPAC-to-LSMS interfaces.
3.	The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information in the NPAC is a representation of the 1K Block managed by the Pooling Administrator, and represented in the LERG.
4.	The NPAC Customer SOA NPA-NXX-X Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider accepts NPA-NXX-X downloads from the NPAC (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no) to their SOA via the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface.
5.	The NPAC Customer LSMS NPA-NXX-X Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider accepts NPA-NXX-X downloads from the NPAC (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no) to their LSMS via the NPAC SMS-to-Local SMS Interface.
6.	The NPAC Customer Data Model (logical) and Service Provider Profile (physical) refer to the same information.
7.	The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information is broadcast over the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface to all Service Providers in that NPAC region (exclusive of those that have filters for that NPA-NXX, and those who have a SOA NPA-NXX-X indicator in the Customer Data Model set to FALSE), for the block allocation of NPA-NXX-X data to the NPA-NXX-X Holder.
8.	The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information is broadcast over the NPAC SMS-to-Local SMS Interface to all Service Providers in that NPAC region (exclusive of those that have filters for the NPA-NXX, and those who have an LSMS NPA-NXX-X indicator in the Customer Data Model set to FALSE), for the block allocation of NPA-NXX-X data to the NPA-NXX-X Holder.
9.	The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information’s “Effective Date” is the date the LERG, the Pooling Administrator, and the NPAC, consider to be the “ownership switchover” date for the 1K Block from the Code Holder (NPA-NXX owning SP) to the Block Holder (NPA-NXX-X owning SP).
10.	At the time of NPA-NXX-X creation, the NPAC will check for "pending-like, no-active" SVs or “pending-like Port-To-Original” SVs.  If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this NPA-NXX-X.  An error message will be generated for the NPAC personnel.  Additionally, the NPAC Personnel will be able to view the discrepant TNs (on the screen in the Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version REPORT format), then be able to select multiple output destinations for the report, or exit the NPA-NXX-X Creation and continue with other GUI activities.
11.	The Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report will be available to NPAC personnel.  The report will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.
12.	The recipients of the Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report (e.g., Pooling Administrator, Code Holder) will have their own M&P (outside of NPAC) to clean up these SVs (either cancel or activate).  Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will attempt the NPA-NXX-X creation again.
13.	Once the NPA-NXX-X has been created on the NPAC, the Code Holder is prohibited from performing intra-service provider ports.  If TNs were missed during the Code Holder's pre-donation intra-port activities, then NPAC personnel only are allowed to perform these intra-service provider port creates of SVs with no previously active SV, on behalf of the Code Holder.  The NPAC will allow NPAC personnel, via the OpGUI, to create these LISP ports up to the effective date (11:59p of the day prior to the effective date), and to activate these LISP ports up to the Block’s activation date/time.  The Code Holder can also assist in the activation of the LISP ports up to the Block’s activation date/time.
14.	Once the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date has been reached, but prior to the Block’s activation, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder.  The exception to this is during the de-pool process for the NPA-NXX-X (see #31 below).
15.	Once the Block has been created (the record exists in the NPAC SMS and the Creation Timestamp in the Object has been set) in the NPAC, either from a scheduled event on the NPAC, or from a Service Provider SOA sending up the Block, then NPAC processing considers the Block to be “activated” for the Block Holder, and all snapback messages and default routing will go to the Block Holder.
16.	The Block Holder Information is broadcast over the NPAC-to-LSMS interface, when the SP’s LSMS EDR flag in the Customer Profile record in the NPAC, is set to TRUE (non-EDR LSMSs get individual SVs, since the SP's LSMS EDR flag is set to FALSE).
17.	The Block Holder Information’s “Activation Timestamp” is the date/time the NPAC broadcasts block or SV data to the applicable LSMSs.  Only at this point in time are all SPs notified of the “ownership switchover” date for the 1K Block from the Code Holder (NPA-NXX owning SP) to the Block Holder (NPA-NXX-X owning SP).
18.	Block Create messages over the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface will set the SOA Origination to TRUE.
19.	The Block Holder Information's SOA notification is broadcast over the SOA to NPAC Interface, when the SOA Origination on the Block record is set to TRUE.
20.	At the time of Block creation by the NPAC (attempted on or after the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date), the NPAC will check for "pending-like, no-active" SVs.  If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this Block.  A unique alarmable error message (new error message and error number for Block) will be generated and alarm NPAC personnel.
21.	At the time of Block creation by the SP's SOA (attempted on or after the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date), the NPAC will check for "pending-like, no-active" SVs.  If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this Block.  A unique alarmable error message (new error message and error number for Block, but no alarm to NPAC Personnel) will be generated and sent back to the SP's SOA.  A new M&P will require the SP to contact NPAC personnel (USA) and request the generation of the Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report.
22.	The Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report will be created and will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.
23.	The recipients of the Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report (e.g., Pooling Administrator, Code Holder) will have their own M&P (outside of NPAC) to clean up these SVs (either cancel or activate) by the Code Holder and the NPAC Personnel.  Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will attempt the Block creation again (if it is NPAC initiated), or contact the Block Holder SP and inform them that they could re-submit the Block request.
24.	If during the broadcast of the Pooled Data (Blocks and SVs), one or more Service Providers cause the Block to go into a Partial Failure or Failed status, the NPAC will generate a unique alarmable message, and NPAC Personnel will be notified of the error, only when the SOA Origination is FALSE (if value is TRUE, existing M&Ps for partial failure or failed conditions will be used).  M&P will be established to have NPAC Personnel resolve the broadcast failures with the Service Providers on the Block’s Failed SP List.
25.	The NPAC will execute a background process, once a day, to check for Block completeness.  During this background process, the NPAC will check for active blocks that haven’t been verified to contain 1000 SVs (combination of POOL, LISP, LSPP) for that Block..  This is designed to capture any “disconnect requests that were sending on it’s way to old”, which may result in an orphan TN that does NOT have an Active SV.  This background process will be run for the first time within 24 hours of Block Creation (with an Active status), and once every 24 hours thereafter for incomplete Blocks.  For missing TNs that are identified during this process, the NPAC will create, activate and broadcast the missing SVs to non-EDR Local SMSs (i.e., self-fixing create, activate and broadcast of missing SVs).  Once all 1000 TNs have been accounted for in the NPAC, this Block will no longer be checked by the NPAC.
26.	The NPAC will manage the synchronization of, and maintain the integrity of, the data between a Block and the subordinate Pooled Subscription Versions within the Block.  This means that, at all times, the LRN and GTT routing data for the Block and all SVs with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, will contain the same values.  The status for the Block and status for each SV with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, may not always contain the same value.  The matrix to coordinate the status is found in the detailed requirements.  The failed SP List for the Block and Failed SP List for each SV with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, may not always contain the same Service Providers.  The matrix to coordinate the various Failed SP Lists is found in the detailed requirements.
27.	Once a Block is “active”, the routing data can be modified.  This may be performed by NPAC Personnel using the NPAC OpGUI, Service Provider Personnel using the NPAC Low-tech Interface, or Service Provider via the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface.
28.	At the time of NPA-NXX-X deletion (i.e., de-pool), the NPAC will check for “pending-like, with Active POOL” SVs, or “pending-like, port-to-original” SVs.  If any are found, the NPAC will reject the Deletion of this NPA-NXX-X.  An error message will be generated for the NPAC personnel.  Additionally, the NPAC Personnel will be able to view the discrepant TNs (on the screen in the Pending-Like With Active POOL Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-To-Original REPORT format), then be able to select multiple output destinations for the report, or exit the NPA-NXX-X Deletion and continue with other GUI activities.
29.	The Pending-Like With Active POOL Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report will be available to NPAC personnel.  The report will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.
30.	The recipients of the Pending-Like With Active POOL Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port-to-Original Subscription Version report (e.g., Pooling Administrator, Block Holder) will have their own M&P (outside of NPAC) to clean up these SVs (either cancel or activate).  Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will await notification from the Pooling Administrator prior to attempting the NPA-NXX-X deletion again.
31.	The NPAC performs a “cascading delete” when processing an NPA-NXX-X Deletion.  This includes sending deletes of Pooled SV data to non-EDR LSMSs, and sending deletes of Block data to EDR LSMSs.  Once all LSMSs have successfully deleted the Pooled data (the status of all SVs and the Block is Old, and both Failed SP Lists are empty), the NPA-NXX-X is deleted.  Similar to the NPA-NXX-X Creation, the NPA-NXX-X Deletion is broadcast to the appropriate Service Providers, based on the values in their NPA-NXX-X Indicators.
32.	During the de-pooling process, the vacant number treatment responsibility and snapback for TN re-assignment notifications have unique behavior, once the Block has migrated to a status of Old.  As defined in #14 above, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder, once the NPA-NXX-X's Effective Date has been reached.  However, in this de-pooling situation, both snapback messages and default routing responsibility will be the Code Holder.  So, even though the NPA-NXX-X still exists, it has the same behavior as the “pre-effective date” NPA-NXX-X situation.
33.	Once the Block has been deleted in the NPAC, then NPAC processing considers the Block to be “deleted” for the Block Holder, and all snapback messages and default routing will go to the Code Holder.  Additionally, the Block is now available to be allocated to another Service Provider.
34.	For NPA Split processing, at the start of the Split, the NPAC SMS will automatically create a New NPA-NXX-X to correspond to the Old NPA-NXX-X, and will reject the NPA Split request if the New NPA-NXX-X already exists at the time of the NPA Split entry.  The NPAC will remove the New NPA-NXX-X and convert the Block and SVs back to the Old NPA-NXX, if the New NPA-NXX is removed from the NPA Split, prior to the end of PDP.  When adding an NPA-NXX-X during an NPA Split, the NPAC will automatically add a corresponding New/Old NPA-NXX-X for an NPA-NXX involved in a Split.  During PDP, the NPAC will treat Block data similar to the treatment of SV data (i.e., either the Old or New NPA-NXX can be sent to the NPAC, but the NPAC will broadcast the New NPA-NXX).
35.	The NPAC Customer LSMS EDR Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider uses Efficient Data Representation on the Local SMS (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no).
36.	The two new objects that will be broadcast over the interface include the NPA-NXX-X (1K Block) block allocation, and Block for EDR compatible Local SMSs that represent the 1000 TNs of POOL'ed numbers as the 1K Block.
37.	The basis for the National Number Pooling requirements was the Illinois Number Pooling NPAC Release 1.4.  The Number Pooling Delta document, National Number Pooling requirements, represents the requirements for National Number Pooling functionality.

The following table portrays “vacant number treatment” responsibility and “snapback for TN re-assignment” notifications throughout each phase of number pooling, once the Block has been donated to the Pooling Administrator:
Code Holder receives a notification but CANNOT reassign this TN.
NOTE:  for the last column (during Block de-pool), the behavior is the same as the pre-effective date column.  A block may still exist in the NPAC SMS with a status of Old.  At the time of de-pooling, the Block goes back to the Pooling Administrator and is awaiting re-assignment to the next Block Holder.  The NPA-NXX-X may also exist in the NPAC SMS until a Block is successfully deleted from all Local SMSs.


1.3	Background
Release 1.0
An industry task force was formed in Illinois in April 1995, pursuant to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) Order on Customers First Plan (Docket 94 0096 dated April 7, 1995), to develop a permanent number portability solution for Illinois.  During that year, the task force made significant progress in defining and resolving the issues related to implementing number portability. All North American regions for deployment in all North American Local Number Portability Regions then used the work done by the Illinois task force to move forward with LNP implementation.  A group was formed under NANC called the LNPA Working Group that oversaw implementation issues and documentation clarifications to the FRS and IIS for Release 1.0.
Midwest Region Number Pooling
To support number pooling in the Midwest Region requirements were developed and implemented.  The requirements are included in Appendix F for completeness.  If a service provider system is implementing Midwest Region Number Pooling then some of these requirements will supercede other requirements in this FRS document.
Release 2.0
The industry through work in the LNPA Working Group defined requirements for the next major release to be adopted by all regions.  The Release 2.0 as agreed upon in all regions includes enhancements to the NPAC SMS for new functionality as well as modifications to existing functionality.  The major enhancements include service bureau support and network data support for SOA systems as well as enhancements to support service providers implementing wireless portability.
Release 3.0
Through the work of the LNPA Working Group, requirements for National Number Pooling were defined for Release 3.0 of the NPAC SMS.  National Number Pooling is implemented as a replacement to the Midwest Region Number Pooling solution that was implemented as Release 1.4 of the NPAC SMS.  This approach includes the optional use of a new Block object over the interface, such that the NPAC SMS now supports both the 1K Block of TNs using Subscription Versions and the new Block object, to represent a 1K block of pooled numbers.  This approach is further defined in section 1.2.14 Number Pooling Overview, of this document.

This process flow defines the provisioning flow in which a customer ports a telephone number to a new Service Provider.  The service provisioning flow activities are shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.1 NPAC SMS Provision Service Process, on page A-3.
2.1.1	Service provider-to-service provider activities
The new Service Provider will notify the old Service Provider according to processes internal to the Service Providers.
Interactions between Service Providers are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS
Processes for obtaining authorization from the customer to port a number are defined by the Service Providers.  The NPAC is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer authorization.  Details of steps in those processes do not involve the NPAC or NPAC SMS, and are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS functionality.
2.1.2	Subscription version creation process
The Subscription Version creation flow activities are shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.1.2 NPAC SMS Subscription Version Creation Process, on page A-4.
2.1.2.1	Create Subscription Version
When a number is ported, both the old and new Service Providers can send a notification to the NPAC SMS.  The NPAC validates the data for each notification and attempts to match the notification with a concurring notification from the other Service Provider.  If a notification is missing from either provider after a tunable time period, the NPAC sends a request for the missing notification.  If the data provided with the notification is valid, the NPAC SMS creates a pending Subscription Version and awaits the concurring notification.  If the data is invalid, the NPAC SMS reports a specific error to the sender of the data and discards the request.
2.1.2.2	Request missing/late notification
If concurring notification or explicit non-concurrence from the old Service Provider is not received, the process flows to process 2.1.3, as illustrated in Appendix A, Flow 2.1 NPAC SMS Provision Service Process, on page A-3.  If concurring notification or explicit non-concurrence from the new Service Provider is not received, the process flows to 2.6 (Cancel).
2.1.2.3	Final Concurrence Notification to Old Service Provider
The NPAC will send a final concurrence notification to the Old Service Provider who did not send a concurring notification.
2.1.3	Service providers perform physical changes
The two Service Providers involved in the number port will coordinate and perform the physical changes to their respective networks.
Service provider network change activities are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS
Details of steps in the processes that do not involve the NPAC or NPAC SMS, such as physical changes performed in the Service Provider’s networks, are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS functionality.
2.1.4	NPAC SMS "activate and data download" process
The NPAC network data broadcast download flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.1.4 NPAC SMS Activate and Data Download Process, on page A-5.
2.1.4.1	New Service Provider sends activation to NPAC SMS
The new Service Provider sends an activate notification to the NPAC SMS.  If the current date is greater than or equal to the new Service Provider due date, the flow continues.  Otherwise, broadcast of the activation is rejected.
2.1.4.2	NPAC SMS broadcasts network data to appropriate Service Providers
Upon receipt of the activation notification, the NPAC SMS broadcasts the network update data in real time to the appropriate Service Providers' Local SMSs.
2.1.4.3	Failure - notify NPAC
If the NPAC SMS does not receive positive acknowledgment of the broadcast from all Service Providers, the NPAC SMS will rebroadcast the network data download to the Service Providers that did not acknowledge the original broadcast.  The NPAC SMS will perform the rebroadcast a tunable number of times within a tunable time frame.
2.1.4.4	Initiate repair procedures
If the tunable rebroadcast parameters have been exceeded, the NPAC staff will initiate repair processes with the appropriate Service Providers. The NPAC SMS will send the list of Service Providers associated with each failed or partial failure subscription version to the old and new Service Providers.
2.1.5	Service providers perform network updates
Upon receiving the network data download broadcast from the NPAC SMS, all Service Providers’ local SMSs will confirm the receipt of the download broadcast, and update their network elements. The Service Providers may also test their network changes.
Service Provider’s Network Change Validation Activities Are Beyond The Scope Of The NPAC SMS
Network testing performed by the Service Providers, such as testing of call processing and testing of Service Provider network elements, is beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS.

2.2	Disconnect Process
This process flow defines the activities associated with the discontinuance of service for a ported number.  The NPAC Disconnect Service flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.2 NPAC SMS Disconnect Process, on page A-6.
2.2.1	Customer notification, Service Provider initial disconnect service order activities
When a ported number is being disconnected, the customer and Service Provider will agree on a date.  The Service Provider will send a notification to the NPAC SMS indicating the date of the physical disconnect of the number and, optionally, the date that the disconnect information is to be broadcast to all Local SMSs (the ‘effective release date’).
2.2.2	NPAC waits for effective release date
The NPAC SMS will send delete actions containing the disconnect information based on the effective release date specified by the Service Provider.  If no effective release date is specified on the disconnect request, the NPAC SMS processes the request immediately.
2.2.3	NPAC donor notification
The NPAC SMS will broadcast the effective release date and disconnect date to the donor SOA.
2.2.4	NPAC performs broadcast download of disconnect data
The NPAC SMS will broadcast the disconnect information to all Service Providers. If the broadcast is not acknowledged, the disconnect information will be resent a tunable number of times within a tunable time frame. If the tunable parameters for the collection of responses have been exceeded, the NPAC staff will initiate repair processes with the appropriate Service Providers (Flow 2.3), and send a list of failed Service Providers to the current Service Provider.

2.3	Repair Service Process
This process flow defines the activities performed when a problem is detected either by the NPAC SMS, a Service Provider, or by a customer who contacts a Service Provider.  The repair service flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.3 NPAC SMS Repair Process, on page A-7.
2.3.1-A	Service provider receives problem notification from customer
If a customer determines there is a problem with their service, they may contact the Service Provider and request Repair Service.  This is one possible entry point to the Repair Process flow.
2.3.1-B	Service provider receives problem notification from another Service Provider
If another Service Provider determines there is a problem with a customer’s service, they may contact the current Service Provider and request Repair Service.  This is one possible entry point to the Repair Process flow.
2.3.1-C	Service provider receives problem notification from NPAC SMS
If the NPAC determines there is a problem with a customer’s service, they may contact the current Service Provider and request Repair Service.  This is one possible entry point to the Repair Process flow.
2.3.2	Service provider analyzes the problem
If NPAC SMS intervention is needed to resolve the problem, up to three repair actions may be required before repairs can be initiated.
2.3.2-A	Subscription data query required
If a Subscription data query is required to initiate the repair, a query is launched to the Local Service Providers.
2.3.2-B	Subscription data audit required
If a Subscription data audit is required before the repair can be initiated, an audit is initiated with the local Service Providers.
2.3.2-C	Network synchronization required
If network synchronization is required, the process flows to 2.3.5, Request broadcast of subscription data.
2.3.3	Service provider performs repairs
There will be audit capabilities in the NPAC SMS to aid in isolating problems.
Service provider’s repair activities are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS
Details of steps in the repair processes that do not involve the NPAC or NPAC SMS, such as the customer’s notification of problems, the Service Provider’s analysis/troubleshooting activities and the Service Provider’s repair activities are beyond the scope of the NPAC SMS functionality.
2.3.4	Request broadcast of subscription data
There will be audit capabilities in the NPAC SMS to aid in isolating problems. A Service Provider may request a download of subscription data to assist in the repair process, if necessary.
2.3.5	Broadcast repaired subscription data
If inaccurate routing data is found, the NPAC SMS will broadcast the correct subscription data to any involved Service Provider’s networks to correct inaccuracies.

2.4	Conflict Process
This process flow defines the activities performed when Service Providers disagree on who will serve a particular customer.  The conflict flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.4.1 Conflict Process, on page A-8.
2.4.1	Subscription version in conflict
A Subscription Version may be put into a conflict state either by the old Service Provider (assuming certain conditions are true), or as a result of a failure to acknowledge a Subscription Version in Cancel-Pending state by the new Service Provider. Subscription Versions set to either conflict or cancel initiate the creation of an entry in the Subscription Cause Code field identifying the cause of the status change.
2.4.1.1	Cancel-Pending Acknowledgment missing from new Service Provider
If the new Service Provider has not yet acknowledged a Subscription Version in Cancel-Pending state, the Subscription Version is put into Conflict, and the Cause Code is updated accordingly.
2.4.1.2	Old Service Provider requests conflict status
If the old Service Provider requests that a Subscription Version be put in conflict, it must be the first time the request has been made (a request to put a Subscription Version in conflict can only be made once by the old Service Provider). The request must be received in the NPAC a tunable number of hours prior to 12:00 A.M. of the new Service Provider due date and the expiration of the Final Concurrence Window unless short timers are being used for the port.  If the old Service Provider has not satisfied these conditions then the Subscription Version cannot be put into conflict. 
2.4.1.3	Change of status upon problem notification
Subscription version’s conflict status “on” is achieved when a Service Provider notifies NPAC SMS personnel of a disagreement between the new and old Service Providers as to whether or not a TN may be ported.  The old Service Provider can only place a “pending” Subscription Version in “conflict” one time.
2.4.1.4	Change of status upon Old Service Provider non-concurrence
A Subscription Version creation with authorization set to “False” from the Old Service Provider causes the NPAC SMS to place the Subscription Version in conflict during the “Create Version” process (2.1.2).
2.4.1.5	Change of status upon New Service Provider non-concurrence
Non-concurrence from the New Service Provider causes the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version during the “Create Version” process (2.1.2).
2.4.2	New Service Provider coordinates conflict resolution activities
The New and Old Service Providers use internal and inter-company processes to resolve the conflict.  If the conflict is resolved, the new Service Provider sets the Subscription Version status to pending.  If the conflict is not resolved with the tunable maximum number of days, the NPAC SMS cancels the Subscription Version, and sets the Cause Code for the Subscription Version.
2.4.2.1	Cancel pending notification
The cancel-pending notification is used for Subscription Versions where both the Old and New Service Providers have sent their Create message to the NPAC SMS.  The status will be either pending or conflict.
If the Old Service Provider sends the Cancel message, the Subscription Version is set to cancel-pending.  A notification is sent to both Old and New Service Providers.
1.	If the New Service Provider sends a cancellation acknowledgment, the status is set to Canceled.
2.	If the New Service Provider does NOT send a cancellation acknowledgment, the NPAC SMS waits for both Cancellation Concurrence Windows to expire, at which time the status is set to Conflict.
3.	The Old Service Provider may optionally send the cancellation acknowledgment.
If the New Service Provider sends the Cancel message, the Subscription Version is set to cancel-pending.  A notification is sent to both Old and New Service Providers.
1.	If the Old Service Provider sends a cancellation acknowledgment, the status is set to Canceled.
2.	If the Old Service Provider does NOT send a cancellation acknowledgment, the NPAC SMS waits for both Cancellation Concurrence Windows to expire, at which time the status is set to Cancel.
3.	The New Service Provider may optionally send the cancellation acknowledgment.
CN2.4.2.1.	Service provider’s conflict resolution activities are beyond the scope of the SMS NPAC
Details of steps in the processes that do not involve the NPAC or NPAC SMS, such as conflict resolution escalation and arbitration activities are beyond the scope of this document.
2.4.3	Subscription version cancellation
If the Subscription Version status has been set to conflict “on” for 30 days [tunable parameter] and no resolution has occurred, the NPAC SMS will cancel the Subscription Version, set the Cause Code for the Subscription Version, and notify both the old and new Service Providers of the cancellation.
2.4.4	Conflict resolved
When both Service Providers agree to resolve the conflict, the new Service Provider will send a request to the NPAC SMS to change the Subscription Version status to pending.

2.5	Disaster Recovery and Backup Process
This process flow defines the backup and restore activities performed by the NPAC and the Service Providers.  The disaster recovery flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.5 NPAC SMS Disaster Recovery Process, on page A-9.
2.5.1	NPAC personnel determine downtime requirement
If there is planned downtime for the NPAC SMS, the NPAC SMS will send an electronic notification to the Service Providers’ SOAs that includes information on when the downtime will start, how long it will be, and if they will be required to switch to the backup or disaster recovery machine. Downtime is considered planned when the NPAC can provide notification to the Service Providers at least 24 hours in advance.
If there is unplanned downtime, the NPAC will assess how long the primary machine will be down. The NPAC will notify all of the Service Providers by electronic notification and telephone calls to the Service Providers' contact numbers. The notification will describe the situation and the planned action.  The Service Providers will attempt to switch to the backup NPAC.
2.5.2	NPAC notifies Service Providers of switch to backup NPAC and start of cutover quiet period
The NPAC Service Providers will switch to the backup or disaster recovery machine as indicated in the notification.
2.5.3	Service providers connect to backup NPAC
The Service Providers must use an alternate connection route to the backup NPAC and establish associations with the backup NPAC application.
2.5.4	Backup NPAC notifies Service Providers of application availability and end of cutover quiet period
When the backup NPAC application and database are on-line, processes will proceed as normal.  The backup NPAC application will be at the same version level as the primary NPAC application.  The NPAC SMS database will also contain the same routing information as the primary database.
2.5.5	Service providers conduct business using backup NPAC
The Service Provider should continue to process as normal when connected to the backup NPAC.  
2.5.6	Backup NPAC notifies Service Providers of switch to primary NPAC and start of cutover quiet period
When the primary machine is brought back up, the backup NPAC will advise the Service Providers of the timing of their switch back to the primary machine.  
2.5.7	Service providers reconnect to primary NPAC
The Service Providers re-establish associations with the primary NPAC application using their normal connections.
2.5.8	Primary NPAC notifies Service Providers of availability and end of cutover quiet period
When the primary NPAC is available, NPAC personnel will notify Service Providers of the end of the cutover quiet period.

2.6	Service Order Cancellation Process
This flow defines the process performed when a Service Provider cancels a service order.  The service order cancellation flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.6 Cancellation Process, on page A-10.
2.6.1	Service Provider issues service order cancellation
From the time both Service Providers have sent a valid notification of a new Subscription Version to the time the Subscription Version is activated, either Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version. If this occurs, the NPAC SMS will notify both Service Providers that the Subscription Version is in a cancel-pending state.
2.6.2	Service provider cancels an un-concurred Subscription Version
If a Service Provider issues a cancel on a Subscription Version that was created by that Service Provider and not concurred to by the other Service Provider involved in that port, or if the Subscription Version was initiated, then subsequently canceled by the NPAC, the Subscription Version will be canceled immediately and a notification will be sent to both Service Providers.
2.6.3	NPAC requests missing acknowledgment from Service Provider
When notified that a Subscription Version has been set to cancel-pending, the non-requesting Service Provider must concur by returning a cancel-pending acknowledgment to the NPAC SMS within a tunable amount of hours.  If the NPAC does not receive acknowledgment in the allowable time from the Service Provider, a request is sent to that Service Provider for a cancel-pending-acknowledgment.  If the missing cancel-pending-acknowledgment is not received within a tunable time frame, the Subscription Version status is set to “conflict” if it is the new Service Provider that failed to acknowledge, but is set to cancel if the old Service Provider failed to acknowledge.  In either case, the Cause Code is then set for the Subscription Version, and both Service Providers are then notified of the Subscription Version status change.
2.6.4	NPAC cancels the Subscription Version and notifies both Service Providers
When acknowledgment is received from both Service Providers, within the allowed time frame the NPAC SMS will set the Subscription Version to canceled in its database, update the Cause Code for the Subscription Version, and notify both Service Providers that the Subscription Version has been canceled.  All canceled Subscription Versions are purged from the NPAC database after a tunable period.

2.7	Audit Request Process
This process flow defines the activities performed by the NPAC when Service Providers request audits of LNP data.  The audit request flow is shown in Appendix A, Flow 2.7 Audit Process, on page A-11.
2.7.1	Service provider requests audit
Any Service Provider can request an audit of another Service Provider’s LSMS.
2.7.2	NPAC SMS issues queries to appropriate Service Providers

5.1.2.2	System Functionality
This section describes NPAC SMS functionality required to support NPAC personnel and SOA to NPAC SMS interface user requests defined in the above section.
Additionally, NPAC SMS functionality will perform operations which are not invoked by a direct user request. Some examples of this are: monitor a Subscription Version to determine whether the old and the new facilities based Service Providers have authorized the transfer of service for a ported number, issue appropriate notifications to Service Providers, and change the status of a Subscription Version based on tunable parameters.
5.1.2.2.1	Subscription Version Creation
This section provides the requirements for the Subscription Version Create functionality, which is executed upon the user requesting to create a Subscription Version.

	Create Subscription Version - Notify NPA-NXX First Usage
NPAC SMS shall notify all accepting Local SMSs and SOAs of the NPA-NXX, effective date, and owning Service Provider when an NPA-NXX is being ported for the first time immediately after creation validation of a Subscription Version.

	Create Subscription Version - Notify NPA-NXX First Usage of a New NPA-NXX involved in an NPA Split
NPAC SMS shall notify all accepting Local SMSs and SOAs of the NPA-NXX, effective date, and owning Service Provider when a new NPA-NXX involved in an NPA Split, is being ported for the first time, after the start of permissive dialing, immediately after creation validation of a Subscription Version.
5.1.2.2.1.1	Subscription Version Creation - Inter-Service Provider Ports
This section provides the Subscription Version Creation requirements for performing an Inter-Service Provider port of a TN.  There are two types of Inter-Service Provider ports: A port of a TN to a new Service Provider from the Old, or a “porting to original” port.  A “porting to original” port implies that all porting data will be removed from the Local SMSs and the TN will revert to the default routing, which ultimately results in the TN returning to the original “donor” Service Provider.
The primary differences in functionality between these two types of Inter-Service Provider ports is that for a “porting to original” port, the routing data is not supplied and upon activation, a delete request is broadcast to the Local SMSs instead of a create request.
Both port types of Inter-Service Provider ports require authorization for the transfer of service from the new Service Provider.


	Create Subscription Version - Old Service Provider Input Data
NPAC SMS shall accept the following data from the NPAC personnel or old Service Provider upon Subscription Version creation for an Inter-Service Provider port:
•	Local Number Portability Type  Port Type.

•	Due Date   date on which transfer of service from old facilities based Service Provider to new facilities based Service Provider is initially planned to occur.
•	New facilities based Service Provider ID   the identifier of the new facilities based Service Provider.
•	Old facilities based Service Provider ID   the identifier of the old facilities based Service Provider.
•	Authorization from old facilities based Service Provider   indication that the transfer of service is authorized by the ported from Service Provider.
•	Status Change Cause Code - indication of reason for denial of authorized by the Old Service Provider.


	Create “Inter-Service Provider Port” Subscription Version - New Service Provider Input Data
	NPAC SMS shall require the following data from NPAC personnel or the new Service Provider upon Subscription Version creation for an Inter-Service Provider port when NOT “porting to original”:
•	Local Number Portability Type   Port Type.  This field must be set to “LSPP” for Inter-Service Provider ports.
•	Ported Telephone Number(s)   this entry can be a single TN or a continuous range of TNs that identifies a subscription or a group of Subscription Versions that share the same attributes.
•	Due Date   date on which transfer of service from old facilities based Service Provider to new facilities based Service Provider is initially planned to occur.
•	New Facilities based Service Provider ID   the identifier of the new facilities based Service Provider.
•	Old Facilities based Service Provider ID   the identifier of the old facilities based Service Provider.
•	Location Routing Number (LRN)   the identifier of the ported to switch.

8.	Audit Administration
8.1	Overview
An audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting a customer problem and also as a maintenance process to ensure data integrity across the entire LNP network. Audit will be concerned with the process of comparing the NPAC view of the LNP network with one or more of the Service Provider’s view of its network.  In the case of “on demand” audits, audits may be initiated by any Service Provider who has reason to believe a problem may exist in another Service Provider’s network.  Such audits are executed via queries to the appropriate Service Provider’s network, and corrected via downloads to those same networks.  Requirements pertaining to these requirements are given in Sections 8.2 through 8.6.
With audits, two different scenarios are supported, one designed to “sync up” the information contained in the various Local SMS databases with the content of the NPAC SMS database, the other for the NPAC to perform random integrity checks of its own database.
The local SMS will be responsible for comparing database extracts written to an FTP site by the NPAC SMS with its own version of that same data.  Note that the Service Provider network may contain several network nodes designated for local number portability and may also choose to keep its own copy in its respective SMS.  In the second scenario, the NPAC SMS will select a random sample of active Subscription Versions from its own database, then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various Local SMS databases.  Requirements pertaining to periodic audits are given in Section 8.7.

8.8	Audit Processing in a Number Pool Environment
The Audit processing that is described in this section deals with all Subscription Versions in a Number Pooling environment, whether ported, pooled, or pooled ported numbers.  Audit processing in a Number Pooling environment will use the information in the Service Provider’s profile (NPAC Customer LSMS EDR Indicator) to determine whether to send a query for a TN Range only (non-EDR Local SMSs), or a TN Range and Block (EDR Local SMSs).

	Audit Processing for All Subscription Versions in a Number Pooling Environment
NPAC SMS shall process an audit request of an Active-Like Subscription Version(s), by performing the following steps:  (Previously A-2)
•	Validate that the audit request is valid (existing FRS functionality).
•	Validate that the Block associated with the TN contained in the Subscription Version(s), exists in the NPAC SMS.
•	Send queries of TN Range, or TN Range with Activation Timestamp, to non-EDR Local SMSs that are accepting downloads for the given NPA-NXX.
•	Send queries of Block(s) AND TN Range or TN Range with Activation Timestamp, to EDR Local SMSs that are accepting downloads for the given NPA-NXX.
•	Process non-EDR Local SMS responses using same functionality as audits for LSPP and LISP Subscription Versions.
•	Process EDR Local SMS responses for the Block(s) by doing a comparison.  If a discrepancy exists, the NPAC SMS data is considered “correct”, and a correction should be sent to the EDR Local SMS.
•	Process EDR Local SMS responses for Subscription Versions, as follows:
•	LSPP and LISP – Use existing audit functionality
•	POOL – “No Data” is correct response, SVs for other LNP Types need to be deleted.
•	Send audit results and notification of discrepancies, back to requesting SOA, only for the TN Range that was requested, even if other TNs were affected because of EDR Local SMS.  The existing notification report will be unchanged, and will not contain block information.  In cases were an EDR Local SMS erroneously contained a Number Pool Block, the NPAC SMS shall send a Number Pool Block delete to the Local SMS, but shall not report any discrepancy back to the requesting SOA for this Local SMS if this was the only discrepancy.
•	Suppress status change and attribute change notifications, for Subscription Versions, to the Block Holder SOA.
•	Send status change and attribute change notifications, for Blocks, to the Block Holder SOA when the SOA Origination is TRUE, and only when an audit correction causes the status and/or Failed SP List to be updated to different values.

	Audit Discrepancy and Results Notifications for Pooled Number Subscription Versions to Requesting SOA
NPAC SMS shall, for audits of Subscription Versions with LNP Type of POOL, send notifications of discrepancies found and audit results to the requesting SOA.  (Previously A-10)

	Audit Discrepancy and Results Notifications for Pooled Number Subscription Versions for Audited TNs
NPAC SMS shall, for audits of Subscription Versions with LNP Type of POOL, only send back notifications to the requesting SOA, of the audited TNs, even if other TNs were modified.  (Previously A-15)

	Audit Status Attribute Value Change Notification Send for Pooled Number Blocks
NPAC SMS shall send status change notifications, for Blocks, to the Block Holder SOA when the SOA Origination is TRUE, only when an audit correction causes the status and/or Failed SP List to be updated to different values.  (Previously A-35)
NOTE:  Therefore, if an audit causes a correction to be sent to a Service Provider, and the status goes from Partial Failure-to-Sending-to-Partial Failure, nothing is sent to the Block Holder SOA; however, if an audit causes a correction to be sent to a Service Provider, and the status goes from Partial Failure-to-Sending-to-Active, a notification is sent to the Block Holder SOA.  Likewise, if a Failed SP List gets updated, a notification is sent to the Block Holder SOA.

	Audit Attribute Value Change Notification Send for Pooled Number Blocks
NPAC SMS shall send an attribute change notifications, for Blocks, to the Block Holder SOA when the SOA Origination is TRUE, only when an audit correction causes the status and/or Failed SP List to be updated to different values.  (Previously A-36)
NOTE:  Therefore, if an audit causes a correction to be sent to a Service Provider, and the status goes from Partial Failure-to-Sending-to-Partial Failure, nothing is sent to the Block Holder SOA; however, if an audit causes a correction to be sent to a Service Provider, and the status goes from Partial Failure-to-Sending-to-Active, a notification is sent to the Block Holder SOA.  Likewise, if a Failed SP List gets updated, a notification is sent to the Block Holder SOA.

	Audit for Pooled Numbers and Block to EDR Local SMS
NPAC SMS shall send a query for Subscription Version(s), resulting from the TN Range or TN Range with Activation Timestamp audit request for Subscription Version(s) with LNP Type of POOL, and a query for the corresponding Block of the Subscription Version(s) with LNP Type of POOL, to an EDR Local SMS that is accepting Block and Subscription Version data download for the given NPA-NXX via the NPAC SMS to Local SMS Interface.  (Previously A-40)

	Audit Response – Ignore missing SVs for Pooled Ports at EDR Local SMS
NPAC SMS shall consider a query response of No Data, as a valid response from an EDR Local SMS, for a Subscription Version with LNP Type of POOL, and shall not include this as a discrepancy for the Subscription Version.  (Previously A-50)

	Audit Response – Delete erroneous SVs for Pooled Ports at EDR Local SMS
NPAC SMS shall consider a query response, which contains a Subscription Version, as a discrepancy from an EDR Local SMS, for a Subscription Version with LNP Type of POOL, by sending a Subscription Version Delete message for the Subscription Version.  (Previously A-60)

	Audit Response – Compare NPAC SMS Block to Service Provider Block at EDR Local SMS

Appendix D.		Encryption Key Exchange
The mechanized interface to NPAC SMS requires an exchange of the encryption keys used to verify digital signatures. This exchange will consist of a file containing the 1000 key list, and an acknowledgment of receipt of the list will consist of a file containing the MD5 checksum value of each key in the list. The formats for these files is described here.
Key Exchange File
The following table shows the format of the encryption key exchange file. This file consists of some header information, followed by 1000 instances of key information. There are no separators of any kind between the individual fields, between the header and key data, or between each set of key data.
Table D- 1 -- Encryption Key Exchange File Format
 
Key Acknowledgment File
Before a key list may be used, the sender must receive a key acknowledgment file. The key acknowledgment file serves two purposes:
1.	Verify that the key list has been received by the intended recipient.
2.	Verify the correctness of each key in the list.
Furthermore, the need for an acknowledgment of this kind is specified in requirement 
2. Once this file has been received, the sender of the key list can put the list into active use.
Table D-1 below shows the format of the encryption key acknowledgment file. This file consists of some header information, followed by 1000 instances of key hash information. There are no separators of any kind between the individual fields, between the header and key hash data, or between each set of key hash data. The MD5 hash value will be calculated from the public modulus value of the key.
Table D- 2 -- Encryption Key Acknowledgement File Format

Key Exchange using PGP
LNP Key exchange can be accomplished via email, ftp or an exchange of physical media using PGP for security. Using PGP, a Service Provider will generate a pair of keys, one private and one public. The Service Provider will transmit the public key to the NPAC. This may be done via email or ftp, or any other mechanism of exchanging files. The key in this file is then saved by the NPAC’s PGP program. This key can now be used to encrypt files that only the Service Provider may decrypt, even if the key is intercepted by someone, it will not matter, they cannot use it to do anything other than encrypt messages for the Service Provider.
At this point, the NPAC can encrypt a file containing the keys for the Service Provider. This file may be emailed, put on the ftp site, or put on a disk for the Service Provider.
For LNP key lists that the Service Provider must provide to the NPAC, the reverse procedure would apply. First the NPAC would send a public key to the Service Provider. The Service Provider then encrypts their key list using the public key, and somehow gets the encrypted file to the NPAC. 


Appendix E.	Download File Examples
