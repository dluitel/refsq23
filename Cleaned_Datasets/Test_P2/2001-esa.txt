1.0 SCOPE
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) identifies the requirements for the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) ground data system for the Mars Express mission.
1.1 Project Identification

1.2 Data System Overview
The ASPERA-3 instrument package (or ASPERA-3 experiment) will be flown on the Mars Express mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will be launched in June 2003 according to the current schedule. ASPERA-3 contains a number of different sensors that will measure the particles, neutral atoms, and fields in the near Martian environment. Southwest Research Institute is providing the data system to produce data products in a form suitable for analysis and archiving. These data products will be put into a form known as the Instrument Data File Set (IDFS).
The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is a ground data system responsible for processing all of the ASPERA-3 telemetry. The APAF data system acquires the telemetry data via NISN, processes the data into IDFS data sets, distributes the IDFS data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival.
The first step in defining the IDFS data sets is to identify the physical instruments that make up the ASPERA-3 experiment and any ancillary data necessary for scientific analysis. There are six components of the ASPERA-3 package, plus the orbit and attitude data from the spacecraft:
1. Data Processing Unit (DPU)
2. Electron Spectrometer (ELS)
3. Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA)
4. Neutral Particle Detector (NPD)
5. Neutral Particle Imager (NPI)
6. Scanning Unit (SU)
7. Orbit/Attitude (OA)
Each of the physical components will be divided into logical groups (called virtual instruments) in which
each logical group will be formatted as an IDFS data set. Each of the seven components described above will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD) that will define and fully describe all of the data products contained within each individual virtual instrument.

1.3 Goals and Objectives
The APAF ground data system is to provide data processing algorithms and support to IRF for the ASPERA-3 science team (including Co-I’s) in preparation for the Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase of the Mars Express mission. In addition, validation and archiving of all ASPERA-3 scientific data in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) within 6 months of receipt in a form useable by the general scientific community is to be provided by the APAF.

1.4 Document Overview
Section 2 is an overview of the descriptions of requirement determination, qualification procedures, rationale, and traceability that are used in the identification and the definitions of the requirements. The requirements of the APAF data system are categorized and defined in Section 3. Section 4 contains general information to aid in the understanding of this specification.

2.0 REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTIONS
2.1 Requirement Identification
Each requirement shall be:
• Necessary: It states a condition for the acceptance of the system.
• Verifiable: It is stated in such a way that an objective test can be defined for it.
• Attainable: It is technically feasible and can be accomplished within schedule and budget.
• Clear: It is singular, concise, and simple.
Each requirement shall be:
• assigned a project-unique identifier.
• annotated with associated qualification (verification) methods (see section 2.2). 
• annotated with rationale (see section 2.3).
• annotated with associated traceability to their source (see section 2.4).

2.2 Qualification Provisions
For each requirement in Section 3, the method(s) to be used to verify that the requirement has been met is annotated. Qualification methods included in this specification are:
• Demonstration: observing function of the system without requiring instrumentation, special test equipment, or subsequent analysis.
• Analysis: processing accumulated data obtained during characterization, calibration, or testing of the instrumentation. For example, simulated instrument data sets can be created from the accumulated calibration and test data by putting this data into the expected telemetry format that will be input into the APAF data system. These simulated data sets can then be processed into IDFS data sets and the Southwest Data Display and Analysis System (SDDAS) can be used to analyze the output from the APAF data system.

2.3 Rationale
The rationale behind each requirement is documented, if applicable, in Section 3 along with each requirement. Rationale may include:
• assumptions
• why a requirement is needed
• how a requirement is related to expected operations 
• design decisions made at higher system levels

2.4 Requirements Traceability
The relationship between each requirement and the project item(s) that it addresses is documented along with each requirement identified in Section 3. A requirement may address any number of project items including a system-level requirement, a customer request document (e.g., an RFP), a proposal, or other documentation. A requirement may also address a higher-level design element. For proper traceability, the following information is provided for each requirement:
• Requirement Identifier
• Requirement Description
• Requirement Source (e.g. RFP, proposal, SRS, etc): Source of the requirement
• Verification Method (what method will be used to verify the requirement)

4.0 NOTES
To aid in the understanding of this specification, the requirements imposed on SwRI for the development and operation of the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity (MO) of the NASA Discovery Program as they are relevant to the APAF ground data system are documented here. These are taken directly from the Program-Level Requirements for the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity Project which is an appendix to the NASA Discovery Program Plan.
In Section 4.1.1, Baseline Science Requirements, it states:
“...the ASPERA-3 MO shall provide the complete data set of the integrated ASPERA-3 investigation to all ASPERA-3 Co-I’s and the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS). The specific measurements delivered shall be as follows:
