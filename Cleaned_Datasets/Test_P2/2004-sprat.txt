1. Introduction
Privacy and security policies for web-based systems are often developed as an afterthought. The implications are significant because the systems’ requirements, policies and functionality are often misaligned and/or in conflict with each other. Organizations risk customer mistrust based upon customer perceptions of conflicting privacy statements. The identification of high-level goals is fundamental to requirements analysis specification process. This can be achieved by asking 'why' questions about the operational descriptions of the system available. Goals are important in the requirements engineering process because they bring completeness and ease of readability to the requirements. They also provide rationale for requirements and help detect conflicts. On the other hand, scenarios are used to specify desired behavior of the system and are the means of communication among stakeholders. Additionally, they support trade-offs amongst design alternatives. Based on the utility of goals and scenarios, there is a need to develop a tool, which will assist analysts in the scenario and goal mining, reconciliation and management processes. The tool aims to maintain a goal and scenario repository for use in continuing analyses of policies and other documents from which goals and scenarios can be derived.
All goals are fully traceable to the policies in which they are stated and are distinguished as either policy goals (strategic goals) or scenario goals (tactical goals) in each policy. This tool will provide strong management, which will offer flexible user defined conditions (like ID, keywords, taxonomy, subject, actor, and occurrences). The tool will also support automatic multi-user analysis results comparison. For example, each analyst can classify goals separately and the tool can automatically check the differences in their classification results for their resolution. Requirements engineers, Chief Privacy Officers (CPO), policy analysts or auditors will be able to use this tool. This document specifies the services that the tool will provide and the constraints under which the system must operate. It contains the following sections:
Description of Modules: This section contains a detailed description of the contents of each module.

2. Module Breakdown
The SPRAT will be comprised of 6 main modules:
-  User Access Module – This module manages access levels and permissions for each class of user. The included access levels are:
a. Administrator
b. Project Manager c. Analysts
d. Guest
-  Goal Specification and Management Module -This module supports goal management in the tool.
-  Policy Management Module- This module supports policy management in the tool.
-  Flesch Readability Index Module- This module supports requirements that calculate the
Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
-  Scenario Specification and Management Module - This module supports scenario
management in the tool.
-  Requirements Specification Module- This module supports the requirements for a system.
-  Legal Compliance
-  Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) module- This
section defines the functional requirements that support RACAF.


3. Module Requirements
This section outlines the services to be provided by the tool. Each functional requirement includes: the purpose of the requirement, a brief description, the origin of the requirement and the priority of the requirement. These priorities have been set based on discussions with the stakeholders. SPRAT is a tool bench and will support several other tools. The software will be designed keeping all the layers in mind. But this summer the focus is on implementing the database and high and medium priority requirements for SPRAT and also implement RACAF.

Priority Level 
Priority Description
      
  High
  High priority requirements are critical and must be satisfied. The system may fail if the respective high priority requirements are not satisfied. Additionally, security related requirements are categorized as high priority.
   
  Medium
  Medium priority requirements are important and desirable, but will not cause the system to fail if not satisfied. These requirements are needed by Qingfeng He for the development of RACAF.
   
  Low
  Low priority requirements are desirable but not necessary. These requirements are non-critical and can be postponed for implementation in later versions of the system.

Requirement Specification: The system will provide users a way to extract goals which is the information pertaining to the usage of a data-item accordings per to the user’s privacy preferences in accordance with the P3P standard. Here the goalsinformation pertaining necessary to accepting as well as rejecting a policy according to user’s privacy preferences are extracted. This involves obtainingparsing the respective documents- privacy policy documents or the user’s privacy preferences and deriving the goalspertinent rules from them.

FR-P3P 5
Requirement Definition: The system shall provide a way to evaluate the information extracted from the P3P privacy policy against the information extracted from the user’s privacy preferences.
Requirement Specification: The system will provide users an unambiguous way to evaluate the information extracted from the privacy policy against the information extracted from the user’s privacy preferences. During the evaluation, following scenarios need to be dealt with:
If the data-usage goals information mined from the P3P policy match those from the user's privacy preferences corresponding to both acceptance and rejection of a policy, then a conflict should be detected and a notification requiring user's intervention raised.
If the goals data-usage information mined from the P3P policy match those from the user's privacy preferences corresponding to either accepting or rejecting a policy, the policy should be accepted or rejected respectively.
If the goals data-usage information mined from the P3P policy does not match those from the user’s privacy preferences corresponding to either acceptance or and rejection of a policy, then again a conflict should be detected and a notification requiring user’s intervention raised.

7. Appendix Glossary
This section contains glossary of the terms used throughout the document.
Administrator
- A super user who has the ability to grant/deny access to anyone he/she chooses. 

Analyst
- A user who is a member of the project team and analyzes the policies assigned to him/her.

Constraint
- A constraint is a limit to a system entity. It restricts possible occurrences or allowable combinations in relationship sets, interactions, object sets, etc.

Customer
- The customer is the originator of requirements, and hence, external to the organization that actually provides the support. Whether the customers are internal or external to your organization, they use the product provided by the software developers as an input to their work processes. Almost anyone you interact with is a customer.

Database
- An electronic collection of data stored in an organized and searchable manner.

Goal
- A goal is an objective of the system under consideration.

Goal Actor
- An agent responsible for achieving the associated goal.

Goal Reconciliation
- The process of comparing goals to identify conflicts, redundancies and synonymous goals and resolve discrepancies.

Goal Mining
- The process of reading privacy policies and extracting goals from them.

Goal Management
- The process of organizing the goals collected from the policies in a readable and easy to access form.

Project Manager
- A user who has access to all elements of a project and delegates work to other members.

Privacy Policy
- A privacy policy is a web site's official statement on
1. what personal information is being collected. 
2. how the information is being used. 
3. how an individual can access their own data. 
4. how an individual can opt-out. 
5. what security measures are in place to protect the user's information during the collection process and in storage [1]

Privacy Goals and Scenario Goals:
A Policy goal reflects general high-level enterprise policies, whereas a scenario goal envisions possible usage situations or practices. Scenario goals are usually instantiations of policy goals, thus having the advantages of being concrete, easier for user to understand and the disadvantage of not being exhaustive. This classification is similar to the distinction between strategic goals and tactical goals in requirements engineering [2] and [3].

Priority level
- This prioritizes the requirements in low, medium or high level.

Project
- A project is a document or multiple documents, which need to be analyzed. These documents can be privacy policies of companies, terms and conditions, handbooks, manuals etc.

Security
- The security of a system is the extent of protection against some unwanted occurrence such as the invasion of privacy, theft, and the corruption of information or physical damage.

Observable (visible) and Unobservable (invisible) Goals:
- Observable privacy goals are those that are extracted in such a way that an average Internet user is aware of data collection while assessing websites with a browser using default security and privacy settings. This is a conscious process and easy to conclude. Information is voluntarily given, shared and used. For instance, emails, surveys, forms.
- Unobservable privacy goals are those that are extracted in a hidden manner that requires users to take a proactive role in learning about website privacy practices (e.g, reading a privacy policy, setting the browser’s security and privacy settings, learning about cookie, etc.). This is a subconscious process and difficult for consumers to conclude. Information is voluntarily given, shared and used.

Traceability
- The ability to trace the history, application or location of an item or activity by means of recorded identification.

Context
- Text surrounding a passage under examination that may throw light on the goals extracted.
