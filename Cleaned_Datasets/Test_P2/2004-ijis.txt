1.	Introduction
The Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) is an initiative being undertaken by Tarrant County, Texas. The vision for IJIS is to define and develop enhanced business processes and supporting technology solutions that result in a more effective and efficient administration of justice in Tarrant County. When complete, IJIS will facilitate rapid sharing of information across the Criminal Justice Community while providing each stakeholder with advanced justice management capabilities.  The goal of the current phase of the initiative is to define IJIS business requirements shared by the Criminal Justice Community. To reach agreement on the business requirements, a three-stage approach will be been used:
1.	A baseline of use cases has been prepared to provide a starting point for discussions with the Criminal Justice Community. The baseline represents a compilation of requirements identified during review of background materials obtained from various sources.
2.	Workshops will be held to collect requirements from the Criminal Justice Community. The baseline requirements, documented here, will be reviewed, and requirements added, removed and refined.
3.	The material provided during the workshops will be consolidated into a single model, and reviewed at a final workshop with representatives from the Criminal Justice Community.
