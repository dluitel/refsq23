1. Introduction
This document presents the business requirement of Unified University Inventory System
(UUIS) in Technology-independent manner. All attempts have been made in using mostly business terminology and business language while describing the requirements in this document. Very minimal and commonly understood Technical terminology is used. Use case approach is used in modeling the business requirements in this document.


2. Purpose
IUFA purpose is to integrate 3 faculties data bases providing Web interface that allows
user to access and manage the integrated inventory.
The IUFA guarantee a secure access to the data from outside university at any time during working hours


3. Scope
The IUFA application give the unauthorised user the possibility to use a web based interface that will available to use any time
IUfA involve to the following operations:
- Transferring assets
- Editing assets
- Modifying assets
- Adding inventory assets
- Creating request to borrow an asset or a reserve a space
- Retuning assets
- Creating a new space
- Approving requests
- Authentication
- Search
- Changing permission
- Output reports
   

4. System Description
4.1. Inventory assets
  Assets in the inventory are classified in 3 types
    Rooms and space
    Software licences
    All other assets
  Assets can be grouped like computer parts
4.2. University structure
  University organizational hierarchy is represented by the following
4.3. Users levels
 Three administrative levels that can approve inventory transactions
  University level (level 3)
  Faculty level (level 2)
  Department level (level 1)
  Users’ level can place inventory requests (level 0)
   IT and security level to maintain the inventory (level 4)
4.4. User roles
  A user can have one of the following role
  University administrators
  Faculty administrators
  Department administrators   
  Inventory administrators: users that can be delegated by any administrative level to work and on the applications assigned permission can varies from one user to another depending on its assigned tasks.
   Inventory administrators can be affected to any administrative or organizational level according to their assigned tasks
   Users: students and professors
   IT team system administrators that maintain the system
4.5. Permissions List
  Permission are should be grouped by role in the following way:
  Department administrator have control on his department inventory
  Faculty administrator have control on his faculty inventory
  University administrator and IT Administrators have the control on the entire inventory
  IT administrators can create different category of permission to help administrators to delegate a part of their tasks
  This list resume all permission that a user can have
1. Request related permissions
  request:create
  request:list
  request:show
  request:edit
  request:aproval or rejection
2. Asset related permissions
  asset:create
  asset:list
  asset:show
  asset:edit and modify
3. Location related permissions
  location:create
  location:list
  location:show
  location:edit
  location:delete
4.University related permissions
  universityPart:create
  universityPart:list
  universityPart:show 
  universityPart:edit
  universityPart:delete
5. search permission
  search:simple
  search:advanced
6. reports related permission
  report:list
  report:show
7. User actions related permission
  user:list
  user:show
  user:editand change permissions
8.  Audit related permissions
  audit:list
  audit:show

Note that permissions for each administrative level are predefined
  Level 0 has the permission to create requests only
  Level 1 can control the assets and locations that he owns
  Level 2 can control the assets and locations that owns and get all level1 permissions
  Level 3 can control the assets and locations that owns and get all level2 permissions
  Level 1, 2 and 3 can delegate some or all of their permission to any user
  Level 4 has all possible permissions. Level 4 for can create and assign permission to a new groups
         
 
5. Functional requirements
5.1. Transferring Assets
  Within the same department: data base can be updated directly without any request
  Inter departments: request must be approved by a DA group member and faculty group member unless it came from a higher level group
  Inter faculties transfer: request can be made by any authorised user and approved by faculty group or higher level
  Transfer outside university should be approved by the university group
5.2. Editing Assets
  Any administrative level user or inventory user can edit an asset that belongs to its department; same thing for faculty user, or university user; in order to make modification if he is authorised to do it.
5.3. Modifying assets
  all fields of an edited asset can be modified except Ids
  a bulk entry file can be used
5.4. Adding inventory assets
  Any DA group member or authorised inventory group member asset is owned by the department
  Any faculty member can add all related departments inventory
  Any university group member can add all assets in the inventory
  A bulk entry can be used to add many assets
5.5. Creating request to borrow an asset or a reserve a location
  request can be made by any authorised user
  After creation a request still pending waiting to be approved by an
administrative level user according to that have this authority
5.6. Retuning assets
  An inventory user should check returned asset and update inventory
5.7. Creating a new location
  IT group members can create a new space and modify floor structure when they receive an exception request from any administrative level
5.8. Approving requests
  Any administration level or authorised inventory group member can display all pending requests waiting for approval from this level and approve those requests
  When request is treated user is notified by email
  Request is added to the waiting for execution list
  Inventory is updated when user receive requested asset
5.9. Authentication
  Authentication is made by user name and a password for all users
  administrative level working on administration computer
5.10. Changing permission
  Any administrative level user can delegate another user to execute some or
  all his authorized actions. And this user acquires the role of inventory administrator
 5.11. Output reports
  Asset report by location
  Request report
  User permission user


6. Non functional requirements
  Usability
6.1.
  It is mandatory that learning time is between 2 to 4 hours at maximum, because many task are delegated to working students. Web interface should use clear and consistence terminology in such a way that user; with basic experience on internet and office; find the application easy to use
6.2.Availability
  The Application should be available always at working hours. Any maintenance or backup operation should be conducted out of working time
6.3.
  The Application should be installed in any Microsoft or Unix platform
  Web application should available to run on browsers like IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera or Safari
  Portability
6.4.Security
  All user are authenticated by user name and a password
  Permission are assigned to user according to their roles
  Only IT team member can access and maintain data base servers locally Query is killed if takes more than 1 min
  Backup operation are executed periodically
6.5.Maintainability
  It is important to design system to facilitated future evolution and facilitate maintenance operations

9. Cost Estimation (COCOMO)
   Considering a 3 months project (14w), 8 people working 10 hours/weak => 1120 hours (/160h) = 7 person months
PM = ai*EAF*KSLOC^bi
KSLOC = (PM/(ai*EAF))^(1/bi)
KSLOC = 1.078
Pricing per hour = $20 Project Total = $22,400.00
