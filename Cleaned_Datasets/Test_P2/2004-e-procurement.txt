1.  Scope and Method

1.1  Scope

This document specifies the functional requirements for eProcurement interoperability in the UK public sector and covers the information content of messages exchanged between public sector Buyers and external Sellers through the procurement cycle from catalogue to remittance.  

These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.  The approach provides a common ‘language’ for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts. 

The messages are specified for implementation as electronic documents, exchanged between Buyer and Seller, marked-up using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and validated using XML schema, in compliance with the e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF).  This specification does not include the XML schema to be used.

No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ‘black boxes’.

The following aspects of procurement are out of scope:
•	Seller discovery; 
•	on-line negotiation and e-auctions;
•	e-tendering;
•	negotiation of terms and conditions of trade;
•	communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g. carriers, banks and fiscal authorities;
•	message transport and security;
•	data protection and retention rules;
•	the application of public sector purchasing policy.

eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way. 

In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.  Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.

This specification is not prescriptive regarding Document variants and, in particular, the business rules that may be required to provide automated support for the provision of copies, revisions and cancellations.

A status attribute is mandatory in all documents with values of:
•	‘original’
o	the Document as first sent; 
•	‘copy’
o	a copy of the original Document, typically sent on request if the original has been misplaced; 
•	‘revision’
o	contains one or more changes from the original Document e.g. new, deleted or amended Item Lines.
o	Note: for a revision, the whole Document may need to be re-issued and manual intervention may be required; 
•	‘cancellation’
o	cancellation of original Document in its entirety.


1.2  Benefits

These requirements support several Government initiatives, including: 
•	the generation of value for money efficiency savings;
•	the wish from ministerial level for the UK to be the best place to do e-business; 
•	that 100% of interactions between Government and business be available electronically by 2005.

The greatest benefits accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.  

One example is the ‘three-way match’ between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.  Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer’s back office.

Cross-Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  This specification provides a clear ‘stake in the ground’ for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.  

Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications. 


1.3  Method

This work has been undertaken within the e-Commerce team in the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), reporting to a joint eProcurement Interoperability Working Group of the OGC and the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE).  A working group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.  These requirements have been refined through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.

The method used is based on the OeE’s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF);  see www.govtalk.gov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.

2.  Business Processes

The scope for this specification is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.  This broad domain is broken down into four main business processes:

Sourcing includes activity prior to placing a formal order, including the exchange of Catalogue information, Requests For Quotation (RFQ) and Quotations.

Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.

Fulfilment includes delivery/despatch notification, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed rectification of any problems.

Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.


2.1  Interactions

Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents (see Table 1).  


2.1.1  Sourcing

The Documents included are:

Catalogue is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.

RFQ (Request for Quotation) is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing to supply specific goods or services.

Quotation is sent from sent from Seller to Buyer to: 
•	set out the terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing or able to supply goods or services; or 
•	in the case of “punch out” (where the Buyer orders on the Seller’s web site), to provide information for the Buyer’s internal processes. 


2.1.2  Ordering

The Documents included are:

Purchase Order is sent by the Buyer to tell the Seller that the sender wishes to purchase goods and/or services.  It is a promise to buy. 

Variants may support revision or cancellation of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fulfilment (changed delivery details, required by date etc).

PO Response is sent by the Seller to inform the Buyer of the sender’s intention to supply goods or perform services in response to a Purchase Order.  It acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be fulfilled in total, in part or not at all.  It may also give additional information about specific delivery. 


2.1.3  Fulfilment

The Documents included are:

Fulfilment Notification is sent by the Seller to tell the Buyer that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed.  The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.

Receipt Advice is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in full or in part and to describe discovered variances e.g. un-notified under-delivery, over-delivery, wrong Items delivered or damaged goods.

Rectification Advice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to tell the Buyer of action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement e.g. the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.


2.1.4  Accounting

The Documents included are:

Invoice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed. 

Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.

Self Billed Invoice is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self billing arrangement.

For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see www.hmce.gov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm
Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.

Credit Note is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer.  It may be used to rectify errors and/or variances in the invoicing process.  

Credit Note is a VAT Document.

Debit Note is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, stating that Buyer has deducted amounts from a Seller’s Invoice.  A Debit Note precludes the need for a Seller to raise a Credit Note. 

Debit Note is a VAT Document.

Remittance Advice is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, notifying payment and stating what Invoices, Credit and Debit Notes have been accounted for.

Statement is sent from the Seller to the Buyer summarising the status of the Buyer’s account and the Invoices, Remittances, Debit and Credit Notes submitted within a specific time period.


2.2  Parties

A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.

A role is a job done by a particular Party.  One Party may play a number of roles in a Document. 

Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.  The Party types, roles names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.


2.2.1  Buyer Roles

Buyer roles include:

Purchasing Manager is responsible for the arrangement and maintenance of trading agreements with suppliers, including Catalogue data. The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.

Originator also known as requisitioner, has the original demand for each Item of goods and/or services.  If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.

Order Point raises Purchase Order. Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.

Delivery Point also known as goods inwards, is where the goods or services are delivered and variances in receipt are identified.

Accounts Payable also known as accounts payable, is responsible for Invoice processing and payment and, in some circumstances, the issuing of Self Billed Invoices.


2.2.2  Seller Roles

Seller roles include:

Sales Point is responsible for all communication with the Buyer up to and including the acceptance of a Purchase Order.

Despatch Point is responsible for the despatch, delivery and shipping of goods and the performance of services. 

Customer Service is responsible for resolving issues arising from Purchase Order fulfilment.

Accounts Receivable is responsible for invoicing and credit control.  It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e. bank details.

Note: Messages to and from banks are out of scope.


2.2.3  Third Party Roles

Third Party roles include:

Carrier is assigned by the Seller or the Buyer to deliver or return goods.  

Note: Messages to and from carriers are out of scope.


2.3  Codes and Identifiers

Semantic interoperability depends on the ability of computers to match identifiers and codes. 

Identifiers and codes are needed to enable:
•	the Seller to identify the Buyer;
•	the Buyer to identify the Seller;
•	both Seller and Buyer to identify the carrier and the consignment;
•	Documents and Lines need to be referenced in subsequent transactions in the procurement cycle;
•	internal instance identifiers may be used to avoid repetition of the same set of information many times within the same Document e.g. Delivery Point;
•	Parties need to be identified for fiscal purposes (VAT No., Company Registration No. etc.);
•	Documents need to be uniquely identifiable for audit purposes;
•	Items are classified for management information e.g. commodity classification, and identified at individual or Catalogue Item level as appropriate.

An identifier may refer to:
•	an individual instance, such as a Document, a person or the serial number on a machine; or 
•	to a category of things, such as the bar codes printed on packages (Global Trade Identification Number [GTIN]), or a commodity classification such as the United Nations Standard Product and Services Code (UNSPSC).

The identifiers, coding and classification schemes used in this specification fall into five groups:

International 
used and maintained internationally, including:
•	country codes (ISO 3166)
•	currency codes (ISO 4217)
•	D&B D-U-N-S company reference number
•	Global Location Number (GLN)
•	GTIN
•	International Commercial Terms (INCOTERMS - International Chambers of Commerce)
•	Units of Measure (UN Recommendation No. 20)
•	UNSPSC

National 
used and maintained nationally, including the OeE Government Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC).

Examples include:
•	Company registration number
•	Postcode
•	VAT reference number

Specified in this Document 
developed for this specification including:
•	Document status
•	payment method 

Application-specific 
a variety of application-specific identification schemes are supported.  These include:
•	Seller reference for Buyer
•	Buyer reference for Seller
•	locally specified identifiers for instances of:
o	Quotation
o	Purchase Order
o	Fulfilment Notification
o	Invoice
o	other document identifiers
•	Line number
•	consignment
•	Item

Because, such schemes are application-specific they can never be relied on to be 100% unique.

Universally Unique Identifiers
Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an instance identifier generated on the fly as specified in ISO 11587.  It is also known as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). 

UUID is a 128 bit string usually formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.  In this specification UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple role instances of the same Party within a single Document. 

UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identifiers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.  




3.  Common Elements

Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.  

The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.  A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.

Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation. 


3.1  Packages
