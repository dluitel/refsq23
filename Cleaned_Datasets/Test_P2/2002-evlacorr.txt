1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The primary goal of this document is to provide a complete and accurate list of requirements for the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System.
The primary audience of this document includes, but is not limited to, project leaders, the designers and developers of the system and the end user. The document may also be of interest to EVLA project scientists and engineers or as a reference for individuals involved in similar projects with similar requirements.
Much of this document is based on preliminary ideas and concepts from NRC-EVLA Memo #015 [8] and previous System Requirement Documents [5] and [9].
The requirements contained in this document are numbered based on the section/subsection in which they appear.
1.2 Scope
The Correlator Monitor & Control System provides the physical link between the WIDAR Correlator hardware and the EVLA monitor & control system. It is the primary interface by which the correlator is configured, operated, and serviced.
The primary functions of the Correlator Monitor & Control System are as follows:
• Receive configuration information from the EVLA M&C system and translate this info into a
physical correlator hardware configuration.
• Process and transfer dynamic control data (models, filter parameters, etc), and monitor data
(auto correlation products, state counts, etc.)
• Monitor Correlator and correlator subsystem health and take corrective action autonomously
(where possible) to recover from hardware and computing system faults.
• Perform limited amounts of real-time data processing and probing such as providing tools to
collect and display auto correlation products.
• Allow for easy system access to aid testing and debugging.

 2 Overall Description
2.1 ProductPerspective
The EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System is responsible for correlator configuration, real time monitor/control, and hardware testing/servicing. The CMCS exists as an integrated part of the overall EVLA Monitor and Control Structure. The CMCS will provide a level of abstraction to modularize the correlator system within the EVLA environment. The “gateway” to the correlator will be through the Virtual Correlator Interface (VCI) which will exist as a software entity on the MCCC.
The CMCS will be designed and implemented as a Master/Slave network with one computer system coordinating the activities of a number of “intelligent” hardware control processors. The Master is expected to handle the bulk of the monitor/control interface with the outside world whereas the slaves will be only concerned with the correlator hardware systems under their direct control. This topology will place the real-time computing requirements in the slave layer and the quasi real-time, network-chaotic loads into the master layer. One of the primary benefits of this structure is isolation (ease of serviceability, programmability) of the correlator hardware from the EVLA M&C environment. The system is expected to be redundant in critical areas and highly modular.
2.2 ProductFunctionality

Monitoring
The Correlator monitor subsystem will provide EVLA system wide access to all correlator system states (including the M&C supervisor system state). Some of this information will be provided on a time synchronous basis as required by other systems (backend, monitor archive, data archive, etc.) and other information will only be presented on a request basis. The CMCS will be a fully observable system with the only limits placed on information access being those imposed by hardware, bandwidth, and/or security restrictions. Error and status messages will be provided in a concise time/location referenced format to upper system levels in a content controllable manner.

Control
Correlator configurations and control instructions will be received from the EVLA M&C system in a form suitable for translation by the MCCC. The translation will provide the correlator with specific goal oriented hardware configuration tables to satisfy the configuration requested by the EVLA M&C. A second interface with a human GUI will also allow for configuration of the correlator hardware, preferably through the same table structures used above. This translation interface will be called the Virtual Correlator Interface (VCI).

Data Output
Specific data sets required by the Backend Data Processing System (state counts, auto correlations, etc) will be provided in a timely and robust fashion over a secondary virtual network. Ancillary monitor data including system health, error messages and configuration echoes will be spooled such that temporary loss of network communication with the EVLA M&C network will not result in loss of monitor data. Data sample rates and contents will be fully controllable via either the EVLA M&C or the Backend processing controller.

Data Input
The MCCC will accept external data feeds for models, time standards, fiber-link phase corrections and other required data to be packaged with control data delivered to the correlator hardware.

Recovery
The ability to attempt recovery from failure or hot-swapped hardware devices will be built into this system. Should a CMIB subsystem fail and not respond to reboot requests or other self-heal attempts, an alert notice will be issued so appropriate personnel can affect a hardware repair. The CMIB subsystem will then be automatically restarted and configured back into the current operational environment.
MCCC health will be monitored by internal software processes (watchdogs) and external systems (the CPCC). Should a non-recoverable MCCC system failure occur, the backup MCCC system
will be activated automatically via the CPCC or by external human intervention? It is intended that both primary and secondary MCCC systems maintain full CMCS state information such that any hard failure (unrecoverable) in the primary node can be corrected by simply rerouting M&C communications to the secondary.
Watchdog processes and the MCCC will likewise monitor CPCC health. Due to the more hardware specific connections and controls of the CPCC, actions taken by external system upon hard failures are TBD.

2.3 Usercharacteristics
All use of the Correlator Monitor and Control System will be through the VCI or MCCC. Software tools will be provided to assist the user at all access levels from system wide configuration and control to a low level CMIB command line instruction.

Array Operator
The primary contact with array operations will be via status and error messages channeled through the Monitor and Control System.

Engineers and Technicians
The ability of the Correlator System to achieve and maintain high reliability and uptime will be vitally dependent upon reliable operation and rapid diagnosis and repair of faults in the hardware and software systems. These individuals will be responsible for performing corrective and preventive maintenance along with periodic performance tests and upgrades. Engineers and technicians will need tools to inspect and monitor individual CMIB layer devices from remote locations and have the ability to fault trace to a specific hot-swappable subsystem.

Software Developer
These individuals are responsible for developing the software and will interact with the system to ensure that it is functioning properly. The software developer requires remote access to the system so that troubleshooting can be accomplished away from the EVLA and during non-working hours.

Web User
A few authorized individuals may be allowed access to parts of the system that are usually considered restricted.

2.4 Constraints

Criticality of the Application
The Correlator Monitor and Control is a critical component in the Astronomical data path. If it is unavailable, incoming astronomical data will be lost.

Computer Hardware Limitations
The ultimate determiner of a reliable and available correlator is dependent on the stability of the CMCS network and control computers. Functionality needs to be modularized to provide the easiest means of fault detection and repair.

Computer Software Limitations
The ultimate ease of use and flexibility of the correlator is rooted in the CMCS software. Full access is required with a high level of data integration to provide the user with a logical and coherent interface.
 

2.5 Assumptions

Configuration Data Stream
It is assumed that the Correlator will receive configuration data in a format that is unambiguous and results in a convergent hardware configuration (requested configuration is valid and achievable).

Auxiliary Data
It is assumed that all auxiliary data needed for real time update of correlator parameters (delay models, fiber round trip phase corrections, time codes, dynamic configuration data, etc.) will be provided directly by the EVLA M&C system or by dedicated servers.

Outgoing Data Stream
It is assumed that the backend data processing and EVLA M&C systems will be capable of accepting output data rates (both those required and those requested) generated by the CMCS.

  Seamlessness – shall be accomplished in a manner that is seamless, in that it does not affect hardware modules or software functionality that it meets at interfaces.

  Hardware Accessibility – all system processing and interconnect hardware shall be readily accessible for maintenance, repair, replacement and/or reconfiguration. This excludes items that due to their physical location, are not practical to configure for ready access (i.e. backplanes)
      

3.8 Security
The CMCS needs a robust security mechanism in place so that unauthorized users are not allowed access. Authorized users are expected to be restricted to software and hardware development, testing, maintenance and operations personnel.
All users of the CMCS must be uniquely identified. This could be done via a username and associated password scheme that would authenticate and authorize the user access to the system and, if applicable, grant the user access to restricted or controlled parts of the system. If a user cannot be identified, they will not be given access. In order to monitor all past access to the system, all attempts to access the system should be logged.
Users’ needs and expectations from the system will be different. Systems operations should be given unrestricted access to all aspects of the system and should have the authority to grant and revoke privileges on a per-user basis. Development, testing and maintenance personnel, on the other hand, require access to some parts of the system, but not all, indicating that an access level is needed that allows privileges to be granted on a per-user and what-do-you-need-to-do basis.

 All users of the system shall login using some form of unique identification. (e.g., username and password)

 All login attempts shall be done in a secure manner. (e.g., encrypted passwords)

 A system administrator shall have unrestricted access to all aspects of the system.

 Each user shall have a set of system access properties that defines the user’s privileges within the system. (e.g., the subsystems a user may control or system tools the user may access).

 The administrator shall have the ability to create and add a new user to the system.

 The administrator shall have the ability to remove a user from the system.

 The administrator shall have the ability to edit a user’s system access properties.
 
 The administrator shall have the ability to block all access to the system for all users or selectively by user. (All blocked users with active sessions shall automatically be logged off.) 


3.9 Installation and Upgrades

 Operations Activities – the system shall continue operations, although not necessarily at full capacity, on all unaffected resources during partial shutdowns for maintenance, repair and/or upgrade.
 
 Replaceability –modular design principles shall be employed to the maximum extent possible. Maximal practical use of available “hot- swappable” devices and components shall be made.



3.10 Documentation
   Hardware – complete and comprehensible hardware systems specifications and configuration information shall be readily available.

   Software Coding Practices – software system and application code shall be well documented and written in a generally familiar language or languages (preferably not more than two). Software shall be written in a style that is easily readable and using practices that allow for minimal confusion.
