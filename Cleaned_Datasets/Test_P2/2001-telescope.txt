 This document defines the software requirements for the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) Control Processor (XCP) Flight Software (FSW). This document is a Level 4 specification as defined in document GSFC-410.4-SPEC-0004, Swift Missions Requirements Document.
1.1System Overview
The Swift observatory is the next in a series of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) medium- class explorer (MIDEX) satellites and is the first-of-its-kind observatory for multi-wavelength transient astronomy. The goal of the Swift mission is to determine the origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and to exploit data from these bursts to probe the early universe. Swift instrumentation will exploit newly discovered GRB afterglow characteristics to make a comprehensive study of approximately 1000 bursts over its planned three-year mission. Swift will determine the origin of GRBs, reveal how GRB blast waves interact with surroundings, and identify different classes of bursts and associated physical processes. To accomplish these mission goals, Swift employs three semi-autonomous science instruments. The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a wide-angle x-ray telescope that detects GRBs. On detection, the spacecraft slews in the direction of the GRB, bringing it into the view of two narrow-field telescopes for higher-resolution multi-wavelength observation. The narrow-field telescopes are the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT).
The XRT is a sensitive, autonomous X-ray Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imaging spectrometer designed to measure the flux, spectrum, and light curve of GRBs and afterglow over a wide dynamic range covering more than seven orders of magnitude in flux. It will refine the BAT positions (~1-4' uncertainty) to 2.5" within 5 seconds of target acquisition for typical bursts, allowing ground-based optical telescopes to begin immediate spectroscopic observations of the afterglow.
The XRT will reuse some components from the following previous projects: Cosmic Unresolved Background Instrument using CCDs (CUBIC), Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), Joint European X-Ray Telescope (JET-X), and the X-Ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) satellite.
The XRT electronics is split into two parts: the XRT Electronics Package (XEP), and the Camera Head.
1.1.1XRT Electronics Package (XEP)
The XEP is mounted on the Spacecraft (S/C) and is comprised of:
• A VERSAmodule European (VME) enclosure with two separate Faraday shielded compartments for separate digital and analog sections
• A split backplane for separate digital and analog sections
• A low voltage power supply with fixed voltage outputs
• A Lockheed-Martin Federal Systems (LMFS) single board computer using the RAD6000 microprocessor
• The Communication board which has a Dual Redundant MIL-STD-1553 (1553) interface, a Real Time
Clock (RTC), a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) to interface to the Telescope
Alignment Monitor (TAM), and a CCD data buffer
• A Relay board which has relays to control the heaters, TAM power, camera door High-Output Paraffin
(HOP) actuators, and the camera pressure relief valve HOP actuator. The Relay board also has the Digital-
to-Analog Converters (DACs) for controlling the CCD voltages.
• The Sequencer board which uses an AD21020 microprocessor to generate the CCD clock waveforms
• The Housekeeping board that reads voltages, temperatures, and pressure.
• The Clock board that drives the CCD’s clock and bias voltage inputs.
• The Signal Chain board that processes the CCD’s analog video output and converts it to a digital bit stream.
The Signal Chain board is dual redundant.
• A Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) power supply with a variable voltage output
• The Engineering Units (EU) will also have an Ethernet board for software development, but the Flight Units (FU) will not.
A one-meter maximum length cable electrically connects the XEP and Camera Head. The XRT Interface Control Document (Pennsylvania State University [PSU] document # XRT-PSU-018) describes the interface between these two components.

1.1.2Camera Head
The major component of the XRT's electronics is the CCD camera. The CCD camera collects science data in the form of images, light curves, photon-counts, and spectral data. The CCD camera has three main modes of operation and up to sixty-four modes total.
The Camera Head is mounted on the telescope tube and is comprised of a CCD and two video preamplifiers.
The CCD itself has an image section, a store section, and two readout registers with video outputs. There are four synchronized three-phase clocks that shift the pixel rows in the image and store sections and shift the individual pixels in the two readout registers. The Clock Sequencer in the XEP generates these clocks. Each readout register has five guard pixels at the output side, and the readout register will not be operated in the split mode; therefore, both readout registers will be clocked in the same direction transferring all of the pixels to one, but not both, of the video outputs. Since the readout registers are comprised of split-pixels, the readout registers have to be clocked twice (double-clocked) to shift out one pixel. The readout registers will be double-clocked an extra 30 times (overclocks) to produce an output row length of 640 pixels. The clocking of an empty output register produces overclocked pixels that are used to determine system noise information. To transfer an image from the Image Section to the Store Section, the Image Section and Store Section three-phase clocks must be clocked simultaneously 602 times. The Clock Sequencer can be programmed with up to 64 waveform patterns which corresponds to the 64 modes of operation previously mentioned.
The CCD is cooled by a TEC. The CCD's temperature is closed-loop controlled by the FSW. Telecommands will control the temperature setpoint, the ramp rate, and the mode — open or closed loop. A digital potentiometer with 100 wiper tap points will control the temperature setpoint. Two digital logic signals will control the wiper position: the up/down input and the clock input.
1.1.4Power
The XRT is powered by the S/C by two 28VDC power buses. They are the Operational Power Bus (OPB) and the Survival Power Bus (SPB). During normal operation, both buses are on. If the XRT fails to communicate to the S/C, the S/C will turn off the XRT’s OPB, thereby deactivating the XEP. The hardware-reset function is exercised by cycling the OPB off then back on. The SPB supplies power to heaters that prevent the XRT from being damaged by low temperatures. The S/C may switch off the SPB, but it will only do this in an emergency condition. The OPB is dual redundant, and the SPB is single string.
1.1.5Communications Network
The XRT communicates to the S/C via a dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B serial interface. Data transmitted to the S/ C from the XRT and commands received by the XRT from the S/C are formatted into "packets" within "frames" in accordance with the Swift 1553 Bus Protocol Interface Control Document (Spectrum Astro document # 1143-EI- S19121). The BAT, UVOT, XRT, two Star Trackers, and the S/C are all networked together on the 1553 bus.
1.1.6Real Time Clock (RTC)
A local copy of the spacecraft clock is maintained and is used to timestamp the data packets, which are formatted as Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Source Packets. To synchronize the clocks in the instruments with the clock in the S/C the S/C provides an At-The-Tone-The-Time-Will-Be message, delivered via the 1553 interface, and an RS422, One-Pulse-Per-Second (1PPS), hardwired signal that is the "Tone."
1.1.7Telescope Alignment Monitor (TAM)
The XRT's tube has uses a device called the Telescope Alignment Monitor (TAM) to measure the change in mechanical alignment of the XRT's tube. The TAM consists of a point source of light that is reflected by mirrors across the length of the telescope tube to a CCD camera. The change in the telescope's alignment is proportional to the change in the position of the point source of light shining on the CCD's pixel array. To obtain a resolution better than the pixel size, a centroid algorithm will be utilized. The TAM receives power from the XEP and delivers image data through an RS-422 serial interface. The TAM power can be turned on or off by a telecommand.
1.1.8Doors and Sun Shutter
The XRT has two doors: a telescope tube door and a camera door. The telescope tube door is controlled by the S/C. The camera door is controlled by circuitry in the XEP. Once opened, the camera door cannot be closed; therefore, it is important that the door is not inadvertently opened.
The Sun Shutter is powered by the SPB and has its own solar panel for backup power. It is automatically opened and closed by a photosensor but can be overridden by a telecommand.
1.1.9Heaters
The telescope tube has 36 heater groups. Each heater group is closed-loop controlled by the FSW with the temperature set point and hysteresis controlled by a telecommand. These controllers are simple on-off type with hysteresis.
The Mirror Baffle has three heater groups: Survival, Control 1, and Control 2. The Survival Heaters are powered and controlled by the Spacecraft Bus. The Control Heaters are closed-loop controlled by the FSW with a temperature set point controlled by a telecommand. The Control Heaters will be driven by solid state relays to allow for the numerous on-off cycles that will be required to regulate the temperature. The XRT Thermal Design Specification (PSU document # XRT-PSU-012) describes the heaters in greater detail.
1.1.10Housekeeping
The XRT monitors several items and reports them as Housekeeping (HK) telemetry. Numbers in parenthesis indicate how many of each housekeeping item are being monitored. The housekeeping items are:
• CCD bias voltages (10)
• CCD clock voltages (16)
• Miscellaneous voltages (7: analog, digital, and clock driver)
• Circuit board temperature sensors (10)
• Mirror temperature sensors (10)
• Telescope tube temperature sensors (20 forward and 20 rear)
• Contamination sensors(4: focal plane, mirror, and one unassigned)
• Mirror baffle temperature sensors (3)
• TEC sensors (4: voltage, current, and temperature)
• Miscellaneous temperature sensors (5: cold finger, CCD, camera, and optical bench interface)
• Miscellaneous sensors (6: camera door position, sun shutter position, camera vacuum pressure, and bellows pressure)
The XRT Data Formats document (PSU document # XRT-PSU-028) describes the HK formats in detail.

3.ABBREVIATIONS

 4.OVERVIEW
 This section provides an overview of the FSW including a system context, operational concepts, goals and constraints, and a list of the computer software components (CSCs) which comprise the FSW. Detailed functional, performance, error recovery, and interface requirements for the identified CSCs are provided in Appendix A.
4.1 System Context
From a system (observatory) perspective, the FSW interfaces with the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) via the MIL- STD-1553B bus and the one pulse per second (1PPS) interface. The interfaces of the FSW in this context are illustrated in the following figure.
Figure 4. Flight Software Context Diagram – External Interfaces
From a XCP hardware interface perspective, the FSW executes on the XCP, stores and retrieves data from XCP Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), and communicates with the Spacecraft using the MIL-STD-1553B Bus. The MIL-STD-1553B and Camera Head Interfaces are contained on the XRT Communications Module (XCM). The interfaces of the FSW in this context are illustrated in the following figure.

4.2 Operational Concepts
 The following sections describe the operational concepts of the FSW, including its functions, interfaces, performance characteristics, error detection, reporting and recovery mechanisms, and ground systems concepts.
4.2.1Functions
The FSW has the following primary functions:
• Process science data from the camera and relay it to the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.
• Receive commands from the SCU that establish the current instrument state and camera mode.
• Transmit detailed housekeeping data to the SCU in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.
• Receive a time message from the SCU and synchronize the XCP local copy of the spacecraft clock.
• Control the heaters on the telescope tube and on the thermal baffles.
• Read the TAM.
4.2.2 Observation Sequence
The XRT supports three different, but very similar, observation sequences. The three observation types are:
• Automatic
• Preplanned
• Target of Opportunity
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a detailed flowchart for the observation types. The sequence shown in the figures assumes the software is in automatic mode and not presently engaged in performing an observation. The sequence starts when a SISCATTITUDE message is received with the IS_SETTLED indication set to false. The message also indicates IS_IN_10_ARCMIN, which is true when the S/C is within ten arc minutes of the target position. When the distance remaining to slew is greater than ten arc minutes, the S/C begins the first of up to three activities that precede an observation. Each activity is initiated when the distance remaining is greater than ten arc minutes and the previous activity is complete. The pre-observation activities are:
• Calculate row bias map
• Calculate image bias map
• Collect raw data image
Figure 8. Observing Sequence (Part 3)
The row bias map is maintained by the system so that it does not have to be recalculated prior to each observation; however, recalculation is preferred to provide the best results. One frame is acquired for the row bias map. Once the frame has been acquired, the software recalculates and stores the updated row bias map. Next, the software recalculates the image bias map, if more than ten arc minutes remain to the target location. The software accumulates 3-6 frames for the recalculation of the row bias map. Otherwise, the existing image bias map is reused. Finally, if the acquire raw data image flag is true and the distance to the target location is more than ten arc minutes, then the software acquires a single raw data image which is saved for later download to the ground.
At this point, the S/C has come to within ten arc minutes of the target or the observation preliminary activities are complete, and the software switches to the fast timing mode. When the SISCATTITUDE message indicates that the S/C is settled, the software starts the main portion of the observation sequence.
The software now acquires a frame of data and begins counting the pixels above a detection threshold. To be considered of interest, this count of pixels must exceed a programmable threshold. If the count does not exceed the threshold, then another image is acquired and summed with the first image. This new image is subjected to the pixel count. This process continues until the count threshold is met or the timeout period is exceeded. If the timeout is exceeded, an “XRT Centroid Error” message is transmitted to UVOT and to the ground (via TDRSS). Otherwise, when the source is detected, the software performs a centroid calculation on the image. If the centroid calculation fails, an “XRT Centroid Error” message is sent; otherwise, an “XRT Position” message is sent.
Next, the software enters the fast timing mode. In this mode, the CCD reports a single value representing the entire image. The CCD reports one pixel every 16 μsec, or approximately 60,000 pixels/sec. The software remains in this mode while the lit pixel rate exceeds 40 cps. Once the count falls below 40 cps, the software switches to normal timing mode. In this mode, the CCD reports one row every 5 msec. Each row report sums up the CCD columns. This method is used until the rate drops below 2 cps. At this point, the software switches to photon counting mode. In this mode, the entire image is collected and scanned for lit pixels. The update rate is approximately once every 2.5 sec. The observation sequence ends when the target is occulted and the S/C slews to a new target.
Preplanned observations differ from automatic ones in that the “XRT Position” message is not used. Processing is otherwise similar. The target of opportunity observations are treated like preplanned observations from an operational point of view of the software.
The FSW has the following states: Off, Boot, Init, Manual, Red, and Auto. The following diagram illustrates these states and their transitions.
The following table describes the XCP states and, for each mode, indicates whether the FSW is commandable, whether the FSW produces any telemetry, and whether or not detector events are processed.
Table 1. FSW States
Table 2. Science Data Acquisition Modes

4.2.3 Interfaces and Performance
Estimates of the maximum amount of memory required to buffer an observation were computed according to the following analyses.
Table 3 shows the science telemetry data rates expected for a burst whose x-ray emission has dropped below about 3 Crabs within 30 seconds. Since in this case it is assumed that it takes the S/C 50 seconds to slew to the source, the flux is already at or below 4000 cps by the time the S/C has slewed to the target and generated an XRT Position and an XRT image report. At this flux, the XRT is generating science telemetry at a rate of just over 100kbps, but only for about 50 seconds. Within 30 minutes, the maximum length of an observation before the target is occulted, the data rate has dropped to less than 700bps. During such an observation the XRT would generate about 2.7MB of data, for an average rate of about 12kbps.
The purpose of the Ramp DACs Mode is to continuously ramp the CCD bias voltages through all possible values.
Used only during Integration and Test to verify CCD bias voltage circuitry before installing CCD. Real-time telemetry (strip chart mode) is used to check this data.

Estimates for Central Processing Unit (CPU) margin are computed in Appendix D.

4.2.4Error Detection, Reporting and Recovery
The following sections summarize the error handling, reporting and recovery mechanisms of the XCP.
4.2.4.1Software Configuration Integrity
The XCP maintains primary and alternate FSW configurations in EEPROM. The primary FSW configuration in EEPROM is software locked to be read-only. The primary FSW provides MIL-STD-1553B communications with the SCU provided there are no failures. The XCP bootstrap software autonomously switches to the alternate FSW configuration in the event the primary configuration fails to boot.
Problems with the FSW that are identified on-orbit can be corrected by patch or by a complete software reload. The FSW contains an EEPROM-resident file system on which an object file containing a software patch can be loaded. This object file can then be dynamically loaded and linked into the active FSW. Alternatively, a complete software build can be loaded to the alternate FSW location in EEPROM and the XCP commanded to boot the alternate configuration rather than the primary.
4.2.4.2Memory Error Detection and Correction
The processor board includes the EEPROM that holds the FSW, including the bootstrap and EEPROM File System (EEFS), and the Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) that is used for program and data memory. The EEPROM includes a section that contains the bootstrap. This section of the EEPROM is software write locked prior to flight and includes a checksum that is compared against the stored data as part of the Built-In Tests (BIT) that are executed on system startup. The DRAM includes Error Detecting and Correcting (EDAC) memory. This facility stores redundant information in parallel with each memory word. Whenever a memory word is read, the EDAC is checked. The EDAC can detect and correct single bit errors. The EDAC can detect double bit errors. Both events cause an interrupt, and the software logs information about the error including the affected address and incrementing the EDAC error count. Multiple bit errors (two or more) cause the software to reset the processor by discontinuing strobing of the watchdog timer, which causes the watchdog timer to reset the board when it times out.
A low priority software task called the Memory Scrubber runs when no other tasks are executing. This task steps through DRAM and reads each location. When a word is read that contains a single-bit error, this routine rewrites it to correct the problem, and the problem is logged to EEPROM through the interrupt mechanism. The scrubbing process seeks to repair single bit errors before they become uncorrectable multiple bit errors. Multiple bit errors uncovered by the scrubber result in a reset, even if the memory was not currently in use for processing by the FSW.
4.2.4.3Error Reporting
Errors are reported in XCP housekeeping telemetry. If an unrecoverable error occurs (such as an uncorrectable memory error), the XCP will reboot via watchdog timer. Detectable exceptions that cause a watchdog reboot are recorded to EEPROM.
4.2.4.4Keep Alive Messaging
A heartbeat message from XRT to the SCU serves to indicate “aliveness” of the XRT Instrument to the Spacecraft.
4.2.5Ground Systems
Ground systems are required for the following purposes:
• Low-level driver integration and testing,
• XCP process integration and verification testing,
• Control and monitoring of XRT on orbit, and
• Operational display of downlinked data.
Low-level driver integration and testing is accomplished using a XCP-resident test application which exercises the hardware interfaces via actual flight software drivers. A Ground Support Equipment (GSE)-resident application communicates with the XCP-resident test application over an RS-232 port which is unused on flight. The GSE- resident application commands the XCP-resident application to output or receive data on a particular hardware interface. The GSE has a direct connection to each hardware interface, and stimulates or measures the interface in accordance with the command sent to the XCP. Because the RS-232 port is not used on flight, each interface can be tested without interfering with the command-and-response communication between the XCP and GSE resident applications.
Simulators are used to facilitate integration and verification of the FSW. To contain costs and smooth integration, the external interfaces to the simulators used for integration testing and verification of the FSW are the same as the ground system interfaces in the Science Mission Operations Center (SMOC). This approach allows, at the

  conceptual level, software and displays built for the display of data during simulated tests, to be reused for the operational display of downlinked data without modification.
4.3Constraints
Certain constraints are imposed upon the specification and design of the FSW and are derived from upper-level specifications and known system design constraints. These constraints are listed in Table 5, along with the implications of the constraint.
Figure 12. Application Software Data Flow Diagram – Task Control

4.4Goals
Table 6 presents goals that serve to guide the specification, design, and development of the software. These goals should contribute to the simplicity (S), reliability (Rl), maintainability (M), reusability (Ru), and testability (T) of the system.
