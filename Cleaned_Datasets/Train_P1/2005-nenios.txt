Introduction
1.1 Goals and objectives
The purpose of this document is to describe requirements for the Nenios Child Care Management (NCCM) software that will serve as a foundation for the final product. It is important that an agreement of these requirements be reached so that everyone's expectations will be met. This document uses written descriptions as well as various types of modeling diagrams to illustrate the high level structure of the application. Although some of these diagrams may seem to convey similar information they typically do so from an alternate perspective. This gives different stakeholders a view of the requirements that is better suited to their area of responsibility.
A Web based solution will be delivered so that users can access the system with their favorite browser. By designing around a standardized language like HTML the application will run on the most popular computer platforms. In addition, a centralized database connected to the internet will allow employees to more easily share information.
The Child Care Management software is intended to provide a computer based system that will assist in managing a child care center. Many of the typical functions involved in operating a center will be automated through software to improve the operational workflow within a facility. For instance, activities like tracking child immunizations and maintaining classroom waiting lists will be performed by the computer system so that employees can spend more time caring for the children. In addition, tasks like processing invoices and printing customer reports will be available within the program to minimize the time that administrative staff must spend creating these documents. This Requirements Specification will describe these as well as many other features of the software in greater detail.  


1.2 Statement of scope
This section contains a general description of the software functionality followed by detailed requirements that will be traced throughout the project.
Before gaining access to the NCCM system an employee will be required to enter their user name and password. An employee's access privileges within the system are determined by their job classification. The administrators will have unlimited access whereas teachers and assistants will have fewer privileges as described below.
Administrators are responsible for registering new customers so they are the only employees allowed to view or edit all account information. When a parent contacts the Care Center to enroll a child an administrator will first check classroom availability. If the classrooms for the child's age group are already full the child is placed on the classroom waiting list. The administrator will then create an account if it is a new customer or edit an existing account for a returning customer.
As the children arrive in the morning the teaching assistant will record the time of their arrival. Likewise when the children leave for the day the assistant will record the time of their departure. The departure time will be used to keep track of late pick ups so the parent can be billed accordingly. If a parent is unable to pick up their child they may send another person, but only if the person had previously been designated as an authorized pick up. The names of all authorized pick ups are maintained in a child's record for this purpose.
One of the teachers responsibilities is to document the behavior of children they supervise. The NCCM system will store this information in a database for future reference. This is especially useful for parent teacher conferences. Teachers will have the ability to add or edit their comments at any time.
Administrators can access a reporting feature that generates preformatted documents summarizing key customer information. In addition to printing these reports administrators are able to print invoices. Invoices will include a special notice if a child is due for a required immunization. Customers will be billed on the last day of every month with a discount applied to those accounts having multiple children enrolled in the Care Center.
Daily reminders are a feature that all employees have access to. An employee can enter the date of an event as well as a message describing the event. On the day of the reminder a pop up message will be displayed when the employee logs onto the system. Acknowledgement of the reminder will permanently remove it from the database.
The following table groups user requirements into various categories. Each requirement is assigned a priority to indicate whether it must be implemented (High) or may be left out (Low). Low priority requirements may be eliminated if it helps meet the scheduled delivery date. Medium priority requirements are not essential and their implementation will be determined as program progresses.

1.3 Software context

There are many key components to the Day Care profession. But the ability of your Day Care Facility to remain in business will be dictated by your ability to manage, facility location, ability to retain children and establish a plan for growth. You will have to manage your facilities in a cost effective, efficient manner in order to maximize revenues per class room yet still remain in compliance with Federal, State, and Local guidelines. This document assumes your facility has already met the Federal, State and Local requirements and will not discuss these issues.
The first topic that will be discussed is the current face of daycare in Illinois. According to Department of Child and Family Services in July 2005 Illinois has 287,000 children in daycare 2,918 are licensed day care facilities in addition there are 10,277 licensed Day Care Homes. The vast majority say 70% of these children are in the Day Care Centers. The parent preference of Day Care Centers versus Day Care Homes might be smaller if home facilities appeared more professional to the parents.
Based on a parent survey compiled by Childcareaware.com the following are general concerns parents will have when observing your facilities. Is there a child focused staff without appearing to be overwhelmed? Is every child viewed as unique and special individual? Are the caregivers and teacher practices responsive to the abilities of different children? Are special events scheduled and shared with the family? Is there a balance between activities and quiet time and are activities right for each age group? Can you afford to waste valuable resources convincing parents that staff can responsibly address these issues?
These issues and more can be achieved via Code Works day care software which will keep facility operators updated with daily activities along with reminders designed to dialogue with parents. Billing invoices, immunizations and other items of concern to parents/guardians are all added to allow technology to ease the minds of facility operators allowing them to focus on staff/class supervision. Parents will also have peace of mind knowing that facility operators are able to ensure staff focus is on the children and not the mundane but important bookkeeping aspects of facility management.
Code Works day care software has detailed billing which includes history of payments received, student tuition and tracking of late fees. These features will help the facility operator keep a tab on profit/loss which is imperative for short and long term cash flow management. The hidden benefit is that a profit/loss statement can be generated at all times. Lending institution will want to see this document prior to loaning funds to your business for capitol improvements.
The future of Day Care in America is bright which means that current Day care facility operators will have to plan for the future if they are to benefit from the positive social changes as well as the demographics which favor the expansion of day care and early childhood development. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the United States is
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the United States is in the midst of a childcare revolution the will continue to strain the current system. Dual-earners families can account for about 75 percent of the increased demand for childcare. It is estimated that by 2005, the labor force participation of women ages 25-54 (the traditional at-home caregivers) will increase from 75-84 percent. In addition high divorce rates and the steady increase of births occurring out of wedlock will add to this demand. These trends are similar in Chicago where since the year 2000 at least 50% of all children ages 3-5 were enrolled in some type of day care. Therefore there is continued demand and future growth for this business segment. According to Dun and Bradstreet April 2004, there are 133,020 child care services facilities operating nationally with an average of 7 employees and generates .20 million in sales annually. The annual growth for child care services averaged 7.44 percent between 1898 and 2002. Code Works day care software is leading the way in providing the features necessary to increase enrollment. The waitlist feature along with customer tracking will allow the facility owners to be notified when student has dropped or when the age limitation has been reached. The software allow for discounting enrollment for parent referral and multiple child attendance. Code Works also has the expertise to deliver software using various software models that can deliver continued feature upgrades based upon the growth and level of service your facility requires.
