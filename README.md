# REFSQ
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation artifacts for "Using Language Models for Enhancing the Completeness of Natural-language Requirements" in sumbission to REFSQ 2023.


# Prerequisite
Python 3.8.10

WEKA 3-8-5 


# Installation Instructions
The following steps demonstrate how to use this repository to utilize BERT's MLM for completeness checking. The code has been streamlined to simplify the process of filtering relevant predicted terms, generated by BERT, for a supplied RS.
1. Run RQ1_Script.py using the provided samples or with a cleaned dataset
3. Load WEKA (available at https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)  and create new Explorer project
5. In the Classify tab: 
    - Unzip and load P1 Model corresponding to desired filtering aggression 
    - Set ARFF file (generated in Step 1) as the supplied test set
6. Click "More options..." and select "CSV" under "Output predictions"
7. Select "Re-evaluate model on current test set"
8. Copy output of "Predictions on user test set" into new CSV file
9. Extract predicted column values into "Predictions_Class.csv" (also generated in Step 1)
